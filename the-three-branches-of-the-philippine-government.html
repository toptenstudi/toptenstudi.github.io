The government seeks to act in the best interests of its citizens through this system of check and balance.</p><br />

                            2. explain the three branches of the Philippine government​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Legislative branch is authorized to make laws, alter, and repeal them through the power vested in the Philippine Congress. This institution is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives.
</p><p>The Executive branch carries out laws. It is composed of the President and the Vice President who are elected by direct popular vote and serve a term of six years. The Constitution grants the President authority to appoint his Cabinet. These departments form a large portion of the country’s bureaucracy.
</p><p>The Judicial branch evaluates laws. It holds the power to settle controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable. This branch determines whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part and instrumentality of the government. It is made up of a Supreme Court and lower courts.
</p><p>Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>The President can veto laws passed by Congress.
</p><p>Congress confirms or rejects the President's appointments and can remove the President from office in exceptional circumstances.
</p><p>The Justices of the Supreme Court, who can overturn unconstitutional laws, are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
</p><p>The Philippine government seeks to act in the best interests of its citizens through this system of checks and balances.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Constitution expressly grants the Supreme Court the power of Judicial Review as the power to declare a treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance or regulation unconstitutional.  </p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Legislative Department
</p><p>The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects Presidential appointments, and has the authority to declare war. This branch includes Congress (the Senate and House of Representatives) and several agencies that provide support services to Congress.
</p><p>
</p><p>Senate –  The Senate shall be composed of twenty-four Senators who shall be elected at large by the qualified voters of the Philippines, as may be provided by law.
</p><p>House of Representatives – The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations.
</p><p>The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per cent of the total number of representatives including those under the party list. For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or election from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by law, except the religious sector.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Executive Department
</p><p>The executive branch carries out and enforces laws. It includes the President, Vice President, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.
</p><p>
</p><p>Key roles of the executive branch include:
</p><p>
</p><p>President – The President leads the country. He/she is the head of state, leader of the national government, and Commander in Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines. The President serves a six-year term and cannot be re-elected.
</p><p>Vice President – The Vice President supports the President. If the President is unable to serve, the Vice President becomes President. He/she serves a six-year term.
</p><p>The Cabinet – Cabinet members serve as advisors to the President. They include the Vice President and the heads of executive departments. Cabinet members are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Commission of Appointments.
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Judicial Department
</p><p>The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws, applies laws to individual cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.
</p><p>
</p><p>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws, applies laws to individual cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution.</p><p></p><br />

President of the Philippines<p>Article VII, Section 1, of the 1987 Constitution vests executive power on the President of the Philippines. The President is the Head of State and Head of Government, and functions as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. As chief executive, the President exercises control over all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices. The President of the Philippines is elected by direct vote by the people for a term of six years. He may only serve for one term and is ineligible for reelection. The term of the President of the Philippines starts at noon of the 30th day of June after the election.</p>II. Qualifications<p>The qualifications for an individual aspiring to become the President of the Philippines are outlined in Article VII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution.

This includes restructuring, reconfiguring, and appointments of their respective officials. The Administrative Code also provides for the President to be responsible for the abovementioned offices’ strict implementation of laws.</p><p>2. <strong>Ordinance power. </strong>The President of the Philippines has the power to give executive issuances, which are means to streamline the policy and programs of an administration. There are six issuances that the President may issue.</p>They are the following as defined in the Administrative Code of 1987:<p>• <strong>Executive orders</strong> — Acts of the President providing for rules of a general or permanent character in implementation or execution of constitutional or statutory powers shall be promulgated in executive orders.</p><p>• <strong>Administrative orders</strong> — Acts of the President which relate to particular aspects of governmental operations in pursuance of his duties as the administrative head shall be promulgated in administrative orders.</p><p>• <strong>Proclamations </strong>— Acts of the President fixing a date or declaring a status or condition of public moment or interest, upon the existence of which the operation of a specific law or regulation is made to depend, shall be promulgated in proclamations which shall have the force of an executive order.</p><p>• <strong>Memorandum orders</strong> — Acts of the President on matters of administrative detail, or of subordinate or temporary interest which only concern a particular officer or government office shall be embodied in memorandum orders.</p><p>• <strong>Memorandum circulars </strong>— Acts of the President on matters relating to</p><p>internal administration, which the President desires to bring to the attention of all or some of the departments, agencies, bureaus, or offices of the government, for information or compliance, shall be embodied in memorandum circulars.</p><p>• <strong>General or special orders </strong>— Acts and commands of the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines shall be issued as general</p><p>or special orders.</p><p>3. <strong>Power over aliens.</strong> The President of the Philippines has certain powers over non-Filipinos in the Philippines. The powers he may exercise over foreigners in the country are as follows:</p><p>• The chief executive may have an alien in the Philippines deported from the country after due process.</p><p>• The President may change the status of a foreigner, as prescribed by law, from a non- immigrant status to a permanent resident status without necessity of visa.</p><p>• The President may choose to overrule the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration before their decision becomes final and executory (after 30 days of the</p><p>issuance of the decision). The Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration has jurisdiction over all deportation cases.</p><p>• The president is also mandated by the Administrative Code of 1987 to exercise powers as recognized by the generally accepted principles of international law.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This articulates the most fundamental principal of democracy - The idea that governments exist to represent and secure the rights of the people and MUST BE BASED ON THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.

                            15. branches of philippine government</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One basic corollary in a presidential system of government is the principle of separation of powers wherein legislation belongs to Congress, execution to the Executive, and settlement of legal controversies to the Judiciary.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Legislative branch is authorized to make laws, alter, and repeal them through the power vested in the Philippine Congress. This institution is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives.
</p><p>The Executive branch carries out laws. It is composed of the President and the Vice President who are elected by direct popular vote and serve a term of six years. The Constitution grants the President authority to appoint his Cabinet. These departments form a large portion of the country’s bureaucracy.
</p><p>The Judicial branch evaluates laws. It holds the power to settle controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable. This branch determines whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part and instrumentality of the government. It is made up of a Supreme Court and lower courts.
</p><p></p><p>  Legislative Department
</p><p>The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects Presidential appointments, and has the authority to declare war. This branch includes Congress (the Senate and House of Representatives) and several agencies that provide support services to Congress.
</p><p>
</p><p>Senate –  The Senate shall be composed of twenty-four Senators who shall be elected at large by the qualified voters of the Philippines, as may be provided by law.
</p><p>House of Representatives – The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations.
</p><p>The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per cent of the total number of representatives including those under the party list. For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or election from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by law, except the religious sector.
</p><p></p><p>Executive Department
</p><p>The executive branch carries out and enforces laws. It includes the President, Vice President, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.
</p><p>Key roles of the executive branch include:
</p><p>President – The President leads the country. He/she is the head of state, leader of the national government, and Commander in Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines. The President serves a six-year term and cannot be re-elected.
</p><p>Vice President – The Vice President supports the President. If the President is unable to serve, the Vice President becomes President. He/she serves a six-year term.
</p><p>The Cabinet – Cabinet members serve as advisors to the President. They include the Vice President and the heads of executive departments. Cabinet members are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Commission of Appointments.
</p><p> </p><p>Judicial Department
</p><p>The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws, applies laws to individual cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.
</p><p>
</p><p>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws, applies laws to individual cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. the philippine government is divided into three co-equal branches because it adheres to what principle​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippine government takes place in an organized framework of a presidential, representative, and democratic republic whereby the president is both the head of state and the head of government. This system revolves around three separate and sovereign yet interdependent branches: the legislative branch (the law-making body), the executive branch (the law-enforcing body), and the judicial branch (the law-interpreting body). Executive power is exercised by the government under the leadership of the president. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two-chamber congress—the Senate (the upper chamber) and the House of Representatives (the lower chamber). Judicial power is vested in the courts with the Supreme Court of the Philippines as the highest judicial body.</p><p></p><p>Executive Branch</p><p>The executive branch is headed by the President who functions as both the head of state and the head of government. The president is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The president is elected by popular vote to a term of six years. The president, then, appoints (and may dismiss) his/her cabinet members whom he/she presides over. The executive seat of government is administered officially from Malacañang Palace—also the official residence of the president—in Manila. The President may no longer run for re-election, unless he/she becomes president through constitutional succession and has served for no more than four years as president.</p><p></p><p>The second highest official, the vice-president is first in line to succession should the president resign, be impeached or die in office. The vice-president usually, though not always, may be a member of the president's cabinet. If there is a vacancy in the position of Vice President, the President will appoint any member of Congress (usually a party member) as new Vice President. The appointment will be validated by a three-fourths vote of Congress voting separately.</p><p></p><p>Legislative Branch</p><p>The remainder of the House seats are designated for sectoral representatives elected at large through a complex "party list" system, hinging on the party receiving at least 2% to 6% of the national vote total. The upper house is located in Pasay City, while the lower house is located in Quezon City. The district and sectoral representatives are elected with a term of three years. They can be reelected but they are no longer eligible to run for a fourth consecutive term. The senators are elected to a term of six years. They can be reelected but they are no longer eligible to run for a third consecutive term. The House of Representatives may opt to pass a resolution for a vacancy of a legislative seat that will pave way for a special election. The winner of the special election will serve the unfinished term of the previous district representative; this will be considered as one elective term. The same rule applies in the Senate however it only applies if the seat is vacated before a regular legislative election.</p><br />

                            30. what is the relationship of the three branches of the philippines government ? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The relationship of the three branches of government is inter-connected. </p><p>The Executive branch is the one who carry out the laws and those laws are created by the Legislative branch, the one who hears the case is the Judiciary branch. </p><p>Balance of power also exist so that one branch will not overpower the other one. </p><p>Example if the president vetoed the law, the congress can overturn it by voting 2/3 both the upper and the lower chamber. </p><p>If the law has been signed by the president, and it seems it is unconstitutional then the Judiciary branch can struck down the law as unconstitutional.  </p><p>Oversight also happens where in certain committees on both the upper and lower chamber sometimes call officials of the executive to attend hearing to answer some inquiry and issues. </p><p>All officials appointed by the president is confirmed by the congress.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING</strong></p><p></p><br />
