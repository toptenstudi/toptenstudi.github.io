                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Distributive adjectives are normally used with singular nouns. They include “each”, “every”, “either”, and “neither” and are used to refer to members of a group as individuals.</p><p></p><p>For example, the sentence, “The group received informational brochures before beginning its tour” does not specify whether all the group’s members received brochures. Rather, this is conveyed by the sentence, “Each member of the group received an informational brochure before the tour began.” (Note that the use of “its” no longer makes sense, as “its” refers to “group” in the first sentence – since the subject of the second sentence is “each member of the group”, a more personal pronoun, such as “her” or “his”, or a construction that uses no pronoun at all, such as “before the tour began”, is correct.)</p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Indefinite numeral adjectives are used to specify numerous subjects however they do not give any specific count value. They only provide information about the amount of noun but do not tell the exact amount of noun in the sentence such as all, no, many, few, some, any, certain, several, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many patients standing at the door of hospital.
</p><p>She has bought all the mangoes of seller.
</p><p>They are also used as adjectives of quantity but the difference is that indefinite numeral adjectives are used followed by the countable noun whereas adjectives of quantity are used followed by the singular uncountable noun.
</p><p>
</p><p>For examples:
</p><p>
</p><p>She has bought some eggs from the shop.
</p><p>He has taken some</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />
