                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>•Kitchen Twine<p>-A thick string used for tying and trussing meat. It is also used to tie other foods. It is used on roasts, medallions, and tenderloins to help hold their shape and provide for more even cooking.</p>•Toothpicks<p>-The grooves, which give this type of toothpick a decorative look, also act as a weak point — break off the end, and you have a small stand that you can use to prop up the pointy end so it doesn't contact the tabletop. (That means whether the pick or the table is dirty, sanitation remains.)</p>•Dutch Oven<p>-There are so many different uses for Dutch ovens: Dutch ovens are great for both the stovetop and the oven, making them ideal for braising meat; cooking soups, stews, and sauces; boiling water for pasta; frying chicken; and even baking bread.</p>•Cast-iron Skillet<p>-Cast-iron skillets can be used for sautéing, pan-frying, searing, baking, braising, broiling, roasting, and even more cooking techniques. Pro tip: The more seasoned your cast-iron skillet is, the better flavor it's going to give to whatever you are cooking--from cornbread to chicken.</p>•Large Plastic Brining Bags<p>-Developed to hold food items immersed in a liquid brine, Brining Bags are large clear bags that are made to securely hold the weight of both the food item and the liquid during the brining process.</p>•Thin Boning Knife<p>-Boning knives have long, thin, flexible blades with a sharp tip to make piercing meat easier and safer. The blade is designed to cut through ligaments and connective tissue to remove raw meat from the bone.</p>•Meat Mallet or Heavy Rolling Pin<p>-Meat mallets are used to flatten and tenderize meat. They look somewhat like a hammer, except that the end is rectangular, is much larger than a hammer head, and has a very flat striking surface on one end of it, and protuberances or small spiked-dimples on the other end.</p><br />
