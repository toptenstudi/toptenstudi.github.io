                            1. grade 3 englishwrite a short story on the diffrent kinds of frog​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I got cha</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, in a vast, lush forest, there were many different kinds of frogs. Each of them had a unique appearance, habitat, and behavior.</p><p></p><p>The first kind of frog was the Poison Dart Frog. It was a small, brightly colored frog that lived in the rainforest. It was known for its toxic skin, which could kill predators or even humans who touched it. The Poison Dart Frog was also very fast, which helped it escape from danger.</p><p></p><p>The second kind of frog was the Tree Frog. It was a small, green or brown frog that lived in trees. The Tree Frog was excellent at climbing and had sticky pads on its toes, which helped it cling to branches. The Tree Frog was also known for its loud croak, which it used to communicate with other Tree Frogs.</p><p></p><p>The third kind of frog was the Bullfrog. It was a large, green or brown frog that lived near ponds and lakes. The Bullfrog was known for its deep croak, which could be heard from a great distance. It was also an excellent swimmer and could jump long distances, making it an excellent hunter.</p><p></p><p>The fourth kind of frog was the Goliath Frog. It was the largest frog in the world and lived in the rainforest near rivers and streams. The Goliath Frog could grow up to a foot long and weigh over six pounds. Despite its size, it was a gentle giant and fed on insects and small animals.</p><p></p><p>The fifth kind of frog was the Glass Frog. It was a small, transparent frog that lived in the rainforest. The Glass Frog was known for its unique appearance, as its internal organs could be seen through its skin. It was also an excellent climber and could blend into its surroundings.</p><p></p><p>As the sun set over the forest, each kind of frog settled into its habitat. The Poison Dart Frog climbed onto a leaf, the Tree Frog nestled in a tree, the Bullfrog sat by the pond, the Goliath Frog settled near the river, and the Glass Frog perched on a branch. Despite their differences, each kind of frog was important to the ecosystem and played a vital role in the forest's balance.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A group of frogs was traveling through the woods and two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.</p><p></p><p>The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.</p><p></p><p>Moral: There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. So be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path. The power of words… it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>"Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do."</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The basic story is of a mouse that asks a frog to take her to the other side of a stream and is secured to the frog's back. Midway across, the frog submerges and drowns the mouse, which floats to the surface. A passing kite picks it from the water and carries the frog after it, eventually eating both.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>answered by a robot</p><p></p><p><strong>The plot of the story of "</strong><strong>The Frog And The Mouse</strong><strong>".</strong></p><p></p><p>The frog invited the mouse to his house. But since the mouse cannot swim, the mouse asked the frog to carry him. But halfway across the stream the frog dived down to try and kill the mouse to steal all his food stock. But luckily for the mouse a hawk spotted them and saved the mouse along with a frog. And the frog and mouse weren't friends anymore. </p><p></p><br />

                            13. the story of the tiny frog​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a group of tiny frogs who arranged a competition. The goal was to reach the top of a tower. A huge crowd of frogs gathered to watch the race.</p><p></p><p>The race began.</p><p></p><p>Not one frog in the audience believed that the contestants would reach to the top. After all, it was a HUGE tower! The crowd grew and many yelled,</p><p></p><p>“This is too difficult!’</p><p>“They will NEVER make it to the top.”</p><p>“Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!”</p><p>One by one, the tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower. Still, there was a group of determined frogs that climbed higher and higher. But the crowd continued to yell,</p><p></p><p>“This is too difficult! No one will make it!”</p><p>Discouraged and convinced by the negative cries, more of these tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower. Many frogs who were still climbing complained of the pain and eventually gave up. Some frogs, tired and battered, heard their peers’ complaints and subsequently threw in the towel too.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of this, one tiny frog persisted. He climbed, and he climbed. This tiny frog seemed to have super-frog strength that allowed him to push forward in spite of others failing. Why, though? Why is he able to climb so far when others are failing? the crowd wondered.</p><p></p><p>By now, all the tiny frogs had either collapsed or given up — except for that one tiny frog. The crowd continued to yell, now at the tiny frog:</p><p></p><p>“This is too difficult!’</p><p>“You will NEVER make it to the top!”</p><p>“Not a chance that you will succeed. The tower is too high!”</p><p>But for some reason, that tiny frog climbed further, seemingly unaffected. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. He had reached his destination!</p><p></p><p>All the tiny frogs were amazed as to how this one frog was able to make it to the top. They crowded around him, wanting to know his secret.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, he was deaf.</p><br />

                            14. the story of the frog prince​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time there was a Princess.  Many a suitor came to the palace to win her hand in marriage, but it seemed to the Princess that each one of them looked at her without really seeing her at all.  </p><p></p><p>“They act like there’s nothing more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses,” she said to herself with a frown.</p><p></p><p>One afternoon after one of these visits, the Princess thought, “Sometimes I wish I were little again.” She found her favorite ball from childhood, the one that sparkled when she threw it up high to the sun.  She took the ball to the palace yard and threw it higher and higher. One time she threw it extra high and when she ran to catch the ball, she tripped on a tree stump. The ball fell and plopped right down into the royal well!  She raced over to fetch her ball before it dropped too far, but by the time she got there she could no longer see it in the water.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>Once upon a time there was a Princess.

He dived deep into the well. A few moments later, up he came with the ball held high in one hand.</p><p></p><p>“Thank you,” said the Princess, taking it from him.  </p><p></p><p>The Princess and the Frog Story</p><p></p><p></p><p>She turned to go.</p><p></p><p>“Wait a minute!” said the Frog.  “You promised to spend time with me today!”</p><p></p><p>“I already did,” she said with a shrug.  And the Princess walked back to the palace.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That night at dinner with her family and the royal advisers, there was a knock on the door.  The servant opened the door and saw no one there. The Frog, standing down low, cleared his throat. “The Princess promised to spend time with me today,” said the Frog in as loud a voice as he could.  “So here I am.”</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>That night at dinner with her family and the royal advisers, there was a knock on the door.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>“Daughter!” said the King from the far end of the table.  “Did you promise to spend time with this Frog, as he claims?”</p><p></p><p>“Sort of,” said the Princess.  After a pause, she added, “Oh very well, come on in.”</p><p></p><p>The servants quickly set a new place setting for the Frog, and he hopped over to the royal dining table.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Princess and the Frog</p><p></p><p>Conversation turned to a topic of concern in the kingdom.  None of the royal advisers knew what to do.</p><p></p><p>“Father, if I may,” said the Princess.  “Perhaps we could–“</p><p></p><p>“Stop!” said the King, cutting her off.  “I have enough advisors, believe me.”</p><p></p><p>“If I may,” said the Frog, and it was the first time he had spoken at the table.  “There’s more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses.”</p><p></p><p>The Princess stared at the Frog. How could this little frog – more than anyone else – understand such a thing?</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>“If I may,” said the Frog, and it was the first time he has spoken at the table.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>After dinner, the Frog bowed to the Princess.  He said, “You have done what you said you would do.  I suppose it’s time now for me to go.”</p><p></p><p>“No wait!” said the Princess, “it’s not that late.  How about a walk in the garden?”</p><p></p><p>The Frog was delighted.  The two of them walked in the royal garden, the Frog hopping along the stone wall so he and the Princess were at the same level and could talk easily.</p><p></p><p> </p><p> They laughed about many things. Later, when the sun set, they admired the deep rosy reds it cast in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Princess said, “You know, being with you tonight was a lot more fun than I thought.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>“I had a very good time, too,” said the Frog.</p><p></p><p>“Who knew?” said the Princess with a laugh. She leaned over and kissed the Frog lightly on his cheek.</p><p></p><p>The Princess and the Frog</p><p></p><p>At once, there was a puff of clouds and smoke.  The small green frog had changed into a young prince!  The Princess jumped back in surprise, and who could blame her?  The Prince quickly told her not to worry, that all was well. Years before, an evil witch had put a spell on him that he must stay a frog until he was kissed by a princess.  The witch had laughed an evil laugh, saying, “Like THAT will ever happen!” But it did!</p><p></p><p>Now the Prince and Princess could get to know each other better.  Years later, after they were married, they had a beautiful setting made for the ball and placed it on their royal dining table.  And when the sunlight shone in through the palace windows, the ball sparkled for all to see.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The end</p><br />

The pair hop along on an adventure through the bayous to seek the help of a powerful voodoo priestess.
