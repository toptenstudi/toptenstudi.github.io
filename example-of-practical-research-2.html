1. Consultation from inexperience person may help in finding a current problem of discipline to be
solved, which may serve as basis for formulation of research problem.
2. Intuitions are considered good sources of knowledge as well as sources to find new research
problems.
3. Published Materials such as books and articles relating to the subject of our interest, including
research reports, opinion articles, and summaries of clinical issues, pertinent questions may arise
in our mind
4. If an existing theory is used in developing a researchable problem, a specific statement from the
theory must be isolated.
5. Brainstorming sessions are good techniques to find new questions, where an intensified
discussion among interested people of the profession is conducted to find more ideas to formulate
a good research problem.
6. Day-to-day practical experience of a researcher may serve as a good source of ideas to formulate
a research problem.
7. Discussion among friends can often spark our interest in a problem or provides us with the
reinforcers for pursuing a question, is an example practical experience.
8. Consultation with professionals in a specific field, study specialists, research associations, and
essay counselors will help you identify your problem area.
9. During field exposure, researchers get variety of experiences, which may provide plenty of ideas
to formulate research problems.
10. Sources of topics are suggested (such as COVID-19 pandemic) by more global contemporary

2. Day-to-day practical experience of a researcher may serve as a good source of ideas to formulate a research problem.
 3. Published materials such as books and articles relating to the subject of our interest, including research reports, opinion articles, and summaries of clinical issues, pertinent questions may arise in our mind 
4. If an existing theory is used in developing a researchable problem, a specific statement from the theory must be isolated.
 5. Brainstorming sessions are good techniques to find new questions, where an intensified discussion among interested people of the profession is conducted to find more ideas to formulate a good research problem.
 6. Consultation from inexperience person may help in finding a current problem of discipline to be solved, which may serve as basis for formulation of research problem. 7. During research work, researchers get variety of experiences, which may provide plenty of ideas to formulate research problems.
 8. Usually, at the end of a research, further research problems are suggested, based on the shortcomings of previous research, which can be investigated.</a>

                            16. Ethnocentrism is a worldview that can be observed in several countries. To see this, research on how the concept of ethnocentrism is being observed or done in the United States of America, Japan, China and United Kingdom. Provide one example in each country then answer the following questions. 1. What did you discover after your research? 2. Can you see some observations similar to our own culture? Alternative Q: Which countries have similar ethnocentric views with us? Which countries have different ethnocentric views with us? 3. Why do you think they have these ethnocentric practices? What benefit can they get from doing these? 4. As a Filipino, what practices or values you are proud of that are worth sharing with others? 5. How will you promote these values and practices?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>USA: The concept of American exceptionalism is an example of ethnocentrism in the United States. It refers to the belief that the United States is inherently superior to other countries in terms of political, economic, and social systems.</p><p></p><p>Japan: The idea of "nihonjinron" (Japanese uniqueness) is a form of ethnocentrism in Japan. It is a belief in the inherent superiority of Japanese culture, values, and customs.</p><p></p><p>China: Han nationalism is a form of ethnocentrism in China, which is based on the idea that the Han Chinese are the dominant and superior ethnic group in China, and other ethnic minorities should assimilate to Han culture.</p><p></p><p>United Kingdom: British exceptionalism is a form of ethnocentrism in the United Kingdom, which refers to the belief that the United Kingdom is unique and superior to other countries in terms of its history, culture, and values.</p><p></p><p>1. Through my research, I discovered that ethnocentrism is a pervasive worldview that can be observed in several countries, including the United States, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. Each country has its unique form of ethnocentrism, but they all share a belief in the superiority of their culture, values, and customs.</p><p></p><p>2. As a Filipino, I can observe similarities in ethnocentric views with the United States, as both countries have a belief in their inherent superiority. However, the Philippines has a more collectivist culture, while the United States is more individualistic. Countries with different ethnocentric views from the Philippines may include Japan and China, which have a stronger sense of national identity based on their cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>3. Ethnocentric practices may arise from a desire to maintain cultural identity and a sense of belongingness. It may also serve as a way to differentiate oneself from other cultures and assert one's dominance. These practices can provide a sense of pride and identity for the individual and the group.</p><p></p><p>4. As a Filipino, I am proud of our strong family ties, hospitality, and resilience. These values are worth sharing with others as they promote social cohesion, kindness, and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>5. To promote these values, I can share stories and experiences that highlight the importance of family, community, and compassion. I can also participate in community events that celebrate Filipino culture and traditions, such as food festivals and cultural dances. Additionally, I can encourage others to learn more about Filipino history and culture to foster greater understanding and appreciation of our values.</p><p></p><br />
