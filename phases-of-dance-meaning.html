Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3.

The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5.

                            7. DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5. Besides that pensive view of northwest, the opposite phase is home to big manufacturing companies, such as CDO, Uratex, San Miguel Corporation, Plastic City, Splash, among others.
