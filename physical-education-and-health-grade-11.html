                                            can you tell what causes this person to act this way?​&amp;&amp;.i think he was stressed. you can just see in his face that he is anxious and selfless and seems to be deep in thought. maybe he has a big or heavy problem carrying so he's stressed. look at his form, obviously not even aware of his health. people like that need comfort or need to be entertained because if you just let it be like that for the rest of your life, it will only make you more stressed, which could lead to what they call "anxiety or depression". don't worry too much about your problem, think about health.i just want to put my answers here haha maybe y'all can't answer this question so here it is, especially i don't see any question or answer here. actually it's grade 11 physical education and health hejsjjsj hope this helps!!​</a>
