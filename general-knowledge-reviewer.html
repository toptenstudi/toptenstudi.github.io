That is to attune its present educational goals, objectives, and mission-vision to the demands of a globalized world. Consequently, institutions, especially in the developing countries, have started to reconstruct their global dynamics of knowledge production through establishing linkage among institutions across nations.

These reiterations of what internationalization of higher education should emphasize are actually based on the profound belief that the cultural heritage of people is universal and humankind shares the bond off humanity and global citizenship in the process off advancement of knowledge (Wing, 2010)...

Literature may be defined as “written works collectively, especially, that enduring importance, exhibiting creative imagination and artistic skill which are written in a particular period, language and subject.___________2. The purpose of a review is to analyze critically a segment of a published body of knowledge through summary, classification and comparison of prior research studies, reviews of literature and theoretical articles. ___________3. Reviewing the literature requires the ability to juggle multiple tasks, from finding and evaluating relevant material to synthesizing information from various sources, from critical thinking to paraphrasing, evaluating and citation skills.___________4. The materials must be as recent as possible, may be 20 years back.___________5. It is not necessary that you list down all the important variables which you need in your study and any theories which you think can generates your hypothesis and those that can explain the relationships among your variables.___________6.  RRL is important for a researcher to have a comprehensive and relevant body of supporting materials to his research work. Reviewing related materials helps the researcher to gather valuable data and ideas that can guide him in his own research.___________7. Professional journals and periodicals are usually good sources of    information on studies conducted.___________8. A literature review can be just a simple summary of the sources, but it is usually has an organizational pattern and combines both summary and synthesis.___________9. Reviewing the literature is not like arranging hollow blocks. It is very   important to have consistency in your review.___________10. In selecting materials for the review of related literature and studies, a literature must bear in mind that must be correct or true and morally acceptable. Writers must also pursue truth and morality.​</a>

Do this activity on a separate one whole sheet of paper. There is a challenge posted to higher education. That is to attune its present educational goals, objectives, and mission-vision to the demands of a globalized world. Consequently, institutions, especially in the developing countries, have started to reconstruct their global dynamics of knowledge production through establishing linkage among institutions across nations. Generally, the common set of internalization of higher education highlights the importance of promoting cultural diversity and fostering intercultural understanding, respect, and tolerance among people (Turner and Robinson, 2007). These reiterations of what internationalization of higher education should emphasize are actually based on the profound belief that the cultural heritage of people is universal and humankind shares the bond off humanity and global citizenship in the process off advancement of knowledge (Wing, 2010)... Exploratory in nature, This paper aims to examine the key concepts on IHE. Specifically, this paper reviews articles which will shed light on the significant ideas, and proposes a preliminary framework of IHE in the Philippines. Source:Communica​</a>

The review of relevant literatureis a major part of research activityThe main reason why you need to review literature is for you to establish knowledge or ideaabout your research topic. This activity is not only searching references such as books or journalsfrom the library or internet but also searching references that will enrich your knowledge and willguide you in solving problems.

Do this activity on a separate one whole sheet of paper. There is a challenge posted to higher education. That is to attune its present educational goals, objectives, and mission-vision to the demands of a globalized world. Consequently, institutions, especially in the developing countries, have started to reconstruct their global dynamics of knowledge production through establishing linkage among institutions across nations. Generally, the common set of internalization of higher education highlights the importance of promoting cultural diversity and fostering intercultural understanding, respect, and tolerance among people (Turner and Robinson, 2007). These reiterations of what internationalization of higher education should emphasize are actually based on the profound belief that the cultural heritage of people is universal and humankind shares the bond off humanity and global citizenship in the process off advancement of knowledge (Wing, 2010)... Exploratory in nature, This paper aims to examine the key concepts on IHE. Specifically, this paper reviews articles which will shed light on the significant ideas, and proposes a preliminary framework of IHE in the Philippines. Source:Communica​</h2><br />
