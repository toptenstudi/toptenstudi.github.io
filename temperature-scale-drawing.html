Use wax paper, paper napkins, plastic wraps or aluminum foil for sandwiches to keep them in goodcondition11. Packaging materials are used to package sandwich.12. Chilling is the process of preserving perishable food on a large scale by means of refrigeration13. Wrapping means to draw, fold in order to cover14. Refrigeration is the application of low temperature that changes the state of water in the food fronliquid to solid ice.15. Freezing means to refrigerate or to reduce the temperature of food.​</h2><br />
