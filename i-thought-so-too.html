                                            Is it really my fault for being born this? Having anger issues, trust issues, anxiety is so fking hard. It's so hard for me to open up with my family too. Why did I even end up having this stuff?I can't help it, but why do I always cry when I'm angry? It's hard for me to avoid it, but I'm really trying. They'll always call me dramatic when I do that and I'm so tired of it. I'm always trying to understand them, but I wonder if they can do the same for me too?I feel like they don't even care for what I feel. I've always hated myself because of this and I can only blame myself for it. I don't even have someone who can listen to me. It's hard for me to tell them about this cause they never listen to me. Just how can I even fix myself?So sorry for bothering you, I just want to vent my thoughts in here rn and just excuse my grammar.​</a>

                                            what kind  of thesis of thisWe do not think enough about thinking, and much of our confusion is the result of current illusions about it. Let us forget for the moment any impression we may have derived from the philosophers, and see what seems to happen in ourselves. The first thing that we notice is that our thought moves with such incredible rapidity that is almost impossible to arrest any specimen of it long enough to have a look at it. When we are offered a penny for our thoughts, we also find out that we have recently had so many things in our mind that we can easily make a selection, which will not compromise us too nakedly. On inspection, we shall find that even if we are not downright ashamed of a great part of our spontaneous thinking it is far too intimate, personal, ignoble or trivial to permit us to reveal more than small part of it. I believe this must be true to everyone. We do know what goes on in other people’s heads. They tell us very little, and we tell them very little. The spigot of speech, rarely fully opened, could never emit more than driblets of the ever-renewed hogshead of thought- noch grösser wie’s Heidelberger Fass. We find it hard to believe that other people’s thoughts are as silly as our own, but they probably are.​</a>

She started to read and suddenly noticed that a man, sitting beside her, grabbed a cookie from her bag. She just tried to ignore this.So she munched cookies and at the same time watched how shameless cookie thief was diminishing her stocks. She thought to herself: „If I wasn‘t such a nice person, I would blacken his eye“.When only one cookie was left, she looked with interest and wondered what he would do. He smiled, took the last cookie and broke it in half. She thought: „This guy is so rude, he didn‘t even show any gratitude!”After her flight was called, the woman gathered her baggage and headed to gate. She took her seat in the plane, and started to look for her book, which was almost complete. As she reached her baggage, she gasped with surprise, as there was an unopened bag of cookies. A dreadful thought crossed her mind: „If my cookie bag is here, the other one was his and he just tried to share. She realized that she was the rude one, but it was too late to apologize.Give me 100 words of your realization about the story?​</a>

                                            so we're the first batch of k to 12 students who's now currently in grade 11. and I would like to share my opinion of it, so if you're 1 of the g11 students feel free to share your experiences.now first I noticed in g11 was youre pretty much chilling in the first few weeks. But after that it's like a domino brick has fallen and every week seems to pressure you even more. it feels like the 4th quarter in school and I find this very annoying, I can't spend time with my family. I choosed stem track but I feel like it doesn't prepare me for collage. the teaching method they use here is student centered learning tbh I feel like I'm not learning at all. but then it has to be you to find your answers. and scl from what I've seen its like a tsunami it keeps on moving and you should move early too. I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it. </a>

                                            Why do I like the sound of rain so much?
ANSWER:
 Because it evokes reminders and thoughts of refreshment. It creates a natural symphony when it hits leaves and roofs, etc. It reminds us that we are indoors and cosy, away from the rain, when we are, indeed, indoors and cosy, away from the rain.
It carries with it life-giving, rejuvenating powers, which we are reminded of, when we hear it.
It can herald good new beginnings (but, sometimes, bad ones, too, unfortunately; though, we only begin to think of the latter when the rain is pelting down too hard, for too long).
It conjures up romantic imagery, like dancing in the rain, and making love in the rain</a>

He went out to the street, he looked at the kids that played on the ground, so happy, laughing and enjoying what they were doing. "They seem to have a nice gaine. I want to play too, but I don't know them, and I am too scared to talk to them, maybe they would not like to play with me”, thought the boy. Hence, he sat down in a bank which was near the kids, in order to see them play. Inside his thoughts, he was waiting for the kids to see him and to ask him to play with them, but no one saw him. Until one of them saw him all alone in the bank, nevertheless he turned his sight and still played.​</a>

"I look good!" thought with a grin. It was almost my turn to perform, so I peeked out from behind the curtain. There were so may many people in the audience area. I began to feel a little nervous. But then I saw my parents smiling in front row. "I can do this!" I thought to myself. When the curtain open and the music started. I felt my confidence grow as I remembered all the step I had practiced. First, I heard the beat get fast, so I did a quick spin and tipped my hat. When the beats slowed down, I did a shuffle and twist. I was almost finish dancing when suddenly, I saw that there was a loose board at the front of the stage. But it was too late, I tripped over it and almost fell off stage. I caught myself just in time and jumped backward, pretending like it was just a part of my dance, the music ended and I bowed. Everyone in the audience jumped to their feet and clapped. My parents were cheering loudest of all. I was so happy that I did a little jig and smiled before walking off stage. After the performance was over, my coach gave me a pat on the cack and said, "Nice job, Marcus!".

But after that it's like a domino brick has fallen and every week seems to pressure you even more. it feels like the 4th quarter in school and I find this very annoying, I can't spend time with my family. I choosed stem track but I feel like it doesn't prepare me for collage. the teaching method they use here is student centered learning tbh I feel like I'm not learning at all. but then it has to be you to find your answers. and scl from what I've seen its like a tsunami it keeps on moving and you should move early too. I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it.</a>

But genuinely speaking, i thought my charm is too strong for them that they can't help but be amazed.Thus, they pretend that they know me so that they can have my attention and hope that i'll be they're boy friend but i really can't figure it out or let's just say i dont want to.

But genuinely speaking, i thought my charm is too strong for them that they can't help but be amazed.Thus, they pretend that they know me so that they can have my attention and hope that i'll be they're boy friend but i really can't figure it out or let's just say i dont want to.

I Decree: I dwell in the midst of Infinite Abundance. The Abundance of God is my Infinite Source. The River of Life never stops flowing. It flows through me into lavish expression. Good comes to me through unexpected avenues and God works in a myriad of ways to bless me. I now open my mind to receive my good. Nothing is too good to be true. Nothing is too wonderful to have happen. With God as my Source, nothing amazes me. I Am not burdened by thoughts of past or future. One is gone. The other is yet to come. By the power of my belief, coupled with my purposeful fearless actions and my deep rapport with God, my future is created and my abundance made manifest. I ask and accept that I am lifted in this and every moment into Higher Truth. My mind is quiet. From this day forward I give freely and fearlessly into life and Life gives back to me with magnificent increase. Blessings come in expected and unexpected ways. God provides for me in wondrous ways. I AM indeed grateful. And I let it be so.​</a>

They'll always call me dramatic when I do that and I'm so tired of it. I'm always trying to understand them, but I wonder if they can do the same for me too?I feel like they don't even care for what I feel. I've always hated myself because of this and I can only blame myself for it. I don't even have someone who can listen to me. It's hard for me to tell them about this cause they never listen to me.

                            5. what kind  of thesis of thisWe do not think enough about thinking, and much of our confusion is the result of current illusions about it. Let us forget for the moment any impression we may have derived from the philosophers, and see what seems to happen in ourselves. The first thing that we notice is that our thought moves with such incredible rapidity that is almost impossible to arrest any specimen of it long enough to have a look at it. When we are offered a penny for our thoughts, we also find out that we have recently had so many things in our mind that we can easily make a selection, which will not compromise us too nakedly. On inspection, we shall find that even if we are not downright ashamed of a great part of our spontaneous thinking it is far too intimate, personal, ignoble or trivial to permit us to reveal more than small part of it. I believe this must be true to everyone. We do know what goes on in other people’s heads. They tell us very little, and we tell them very little. The spigot of speech, rarely fully opened, could never emit more than driblets of the ever-renewed hogshead of thought- noch grösser wie’s Heidelberger Fass. We find it hard to believe that other people’s thoughts are as silly as our own, but they probably are.​</h2><br />

                            8. woman was waiting for her flight at airport.She bought a bag of cookies, found a place to drop and took out her book. She started to read and suddenly noticed that a man, sitting beside her, grabbed a cookie from her bag. She just tried to ignore this.So she munched cookies and at the same time watched how shameless cookie thief was diminishing her stocks. She thought to herself: „If I wasn‘t such a nice person, I would blacken his eye“.When only one cookie was left, she looked with interest and wondered what he would do. He smiled, took the last cookie and broke it in half. She thought: „This guy is so rude, he didn‘t even show any gratitude!”After her flight was called, the woman gathered her baggage and headed to gate. She took her seat in the plane, and started to look for her book, which was almost complete. As she reached her baggage, she gasped with surprise, as there was an unopened bag of cookies. A dreadful thought crossed her mind: „If my cookie bag is here, the other one was his and he just tried to share. She realized that she was the rude one, but it was too late to apologize.Give me 100 words of your realization about the story?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>my realization in this story is that we should not judge a person immediately. before judging, we should first look at the situation or confront the person so that we could understand their point of view. we should learn how to understand a situation and not judge immediately just like how the girl in the story did, doing this might save us from embarrassment or help us be kinder to others. this also teaches us not to be close minded individuals who only cares about their situation and does not consider other people at all</p><br />

I wish the subjects would have more relevance of my course because let's be honest I don't want to learn anything about irrelevant topics, I wish you could pick your subjects to learn. but anyways I think senior high needs to be fixed I don't like the pressure all the time and it's kinda sad not have time to spend with my family. so let me know your thoughts about it. </h2><br />
                        this is my opinion.. <br />21st teachers uses student-centered approach to prepare the student to be globally competent. 21st century teacher are facilitators, used authentic assessment, and engage us in a real-world task in order to enhance and develop our learning. Teachers nowadays, not teaching what you are going to learn but teaching us on how to learn. Cooperation is what the teacher ask from us.Hardship is part of your training and a step closer to the success. You have to sacrifice a little bit to be successful someday. Teachers also following the curriculum guide in their teaching. Teachers also find it hard because like you they cant spend time to their family to attend seminars that they can use in teaching us. Maybe, you have to balance your time so that you can spend time to your family. Have time management. And one more thing, the irrelevant topics you've said is the very basic in learning your course. Thank you. Hope you get my point. God bless.*college <br />*chose<br /><br />yep, I feel you. It feels like I'm doing a self-study session<br />

                            10. Why do I like the sound of rain so much?
ANSWER:
 Because it evokes reminders and thoughts of refreshment. It creates a natural symphony when it hits leaves and roofs, etc. It reminds us that we are indoors and cosy, away from the rain, when we are, indeed, indoors and cosy, away from the rain.
It carries with it life-giving, rejuvenating powers, which we are reminded of, when we hear it.
It can herald good new beginnings (but, sometimes, bad ones, too, unfortunately; though, we only begin to think of the latter when the rain is pelting down too hard, for too long).
It conjures up romantic imagery, like dancing in the rain, and making love in the rain</h2><br />

I want to play too, but I don't know them, and I am too scared to talk to them, maybe they would not like to play with me”, thought the boy. Hence, he sat down in a bank which was near the kids, in order to see them play. Inside his thoughts, he was waiting for the kids to see him and to ask him to play with them, but no one saw him.

                            21. can you tell what causes this person to act this way?​&amp;&amp;.i think he was stressed. you can just see in his face that he is anxious and selfless and seems to be deep in thought. maybe he has a big or heavy problem carrying so he's stressed. look at his form, obviously not even aware of his health. people like that need comfort or need to be entertained because if you just let it be like that for the rest of your life, it will only make you more stressed, which could lead to what they call "anxiety or depression". don't worry too much about your problem, think about health.i just want to put my answers here haha maybe y'all can't answer this question so here it is, especially i don't see any question or answer here. actually it's grade 11 physical education and health hejsjjsj hope this helps!!​</h2><br />

I Decree: I dwell in the midst of Infinite Abundance. The Abundance of God is my Infinite Source. The River of Life never stops flowing. It flows through me into lavish expression. Good comes to me through unexpected avenues and God works in a myriad of ways to bless me. I now open my mind to receive my good. Nothing is too good to be true. Nothing is too wonderful to have happen. With God as my Source, nothing amazes me. I Am not burdened by thoughts of past or future. One is gone. The other is yet to come. By the power of my belief, coupled with my purposeful fearless actions and my deep rapport with God, my future is created and my abundance made manifest. I ask and accept that I am lifted in this and every moment into Higher Truth. My mind is quiet. From this day forward I give freely and fearlessly into life and Life gives back to me with magnificent increase. Blessings come in expected and unexpected ways. God provides for me in wondrous ways. I AM indeed grateful. And I let it be so.​</h2><br />

I counted his cash and replied, "You know that you don't have enough money o buy the doll, my dear." The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.

I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister hen she goes there." His eyes were so sad while saying this. "My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see od very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to y sister." My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said, "I told addy to tell Mommy not to go yet. I need her to wait until I come back from the all."
