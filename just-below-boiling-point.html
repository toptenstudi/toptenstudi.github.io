They cannot determine which substance and mixture just by looking at it. So, to distinguish which is which they heated the two samples using an improvised melting dish. Both the two samples were heated at the same time and received an equal amount of heat. After a few minutes, they had observed that Solid A melts completely within a short period of time; while Solid B has portions that seem to be not melting. To find out if you have understood the important concepts of the lesson, answer the following questions below. 1. Which liquid sample is a pure substance?

                                            Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. The name of specific alkanes always ends in -ane. The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is erhane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the table below. The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally boil and melt at higher temperatures.

Both substances are white crystalline powder. They cannot determine which is a substance and mixture just by looking at it. So, to distinguish which is which, they heated the two samples using an improvised melting dish. Both the two samples were heated at the same time and received an equal amount of heat. After a few minutes, they had observed that Solid A melts completely within a short period of time; while Solid B has portions that seem to be not melting. To find out if you have understood the important concepts of the lesson, answer the following questions below. 1. Which liquid sample is a pure substance? Table 1: Boiling point of two liquid samples Observation while heating Samples Temperature Liquid A Liquid B 2. Which solid sample is a pure substance?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Have a clear vision
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course the first important characteristic is to have a clear vision. If you don’t have a clear vision of the business that you are trying to create, then how can you be successful in creating it? First of all you need to figure out exactly the type of company you are looking to build. For example, where do you see it l being in five years’ time? Do you have a goal for the number of customers you’ll have? The number of employees? Having a clear vision of where you want your business to go will help to contribute to its success.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Have a business plan
</p><p>
</p><p>As well as having a clear vision of what you want your business to achieve, you should also have a plan detailing exactly how you will make your business successful. According to Entrepreneur, writing out your business plan forces you to review everything at once; your marketing assumptions, operations plan, financial plan and staffing plan, helping you to spot connections you otherwise would have missed. Within your business plan you should identify what you want to accomplish in the next twelve months to ensure you’re on the right path to achieving your long-term goals for your business.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Create short-term goals
</p><p>
</p><p>As well as having a business plan for long-term goals, the most successful businesses are those which have measurable short-term goals. Specifically, they identify what the company needs to achieve in the next quarter, month and week to ensure that they meet their annual goals. Goal setting is not a one-time event when formulating your business plan, but an ongoing process. It’s important to remember that goal setting shouldn’t solely be about how much revenue you want to generate. It could relate to your service offerings, business growth, or anything that is important to enhancing the business.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Skill development
</p><p>
</p><p>As well as setting goals for the business, you should ensure that your skill development is continuous. Success is the result of expanding your knowledge and developing those skills to the best of your ability, providing investment in your brand and quality assurance. To be successful, businesses should commit resources and time to training their employees to ensure that everyone can work as effectively and efficiently for the business. With the changing nature of businesses, you should provide continual training for your employees, something which you should include within your business plan. You should implement frequent assessments of your training and operations and, if you uncover a weak area, address it through revising your methods.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Be a great marketer
</p><p>
</p><p>Businesses usually receive the most success through their marketing efforts, so ensure that your business has a clear marketing plan in place. Of course, if you’re providing a good service to your customers you will benefit from word of mouth recommendation, but usually you want or need your business to grow faster. The key to your marketing plan is to utilise as many marketing channels as possible. For example, attracting customers through pay-per-click advertising, newsletters and social media is likely to attract more customers than it would from using just one of these channels.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            26. Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. The name of specific alkanes always ends in -ane. The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is erhane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the table below. The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally boil and melt at higher temperatures.
