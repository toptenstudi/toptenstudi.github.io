                        <strong>The Centipede</strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When Eddie saw his sister, her demeanor and appearance seemed like a dagger completed with her brown dress. She was hitting his dog Biryuk with a stick, although hate and rage is fueling inside of Eddie while watching her sister he could not do anything for her sister has a weak heart. This scene was like of many others that had happened before.
</p><p>Characters in <strong>The Centipede</strong>:
</p>Eddie- young boy  Delia- Eddie’s sister
Berto- worker in their house
Biryuk- stray dog Eddie found
<p>He met the dog Biryuk when he and his father were out hunting for birds. With deemed patience they awaited for birds to take a leap to the sky before firing the shotgun. He was taught that hunters spit for good luck and do Eddie did. As they are waiting, a dog suddenly leaped towards the bird who were taking a long time to fly. Eddie fired his father’s shotgun and shot three with one shell.
</p><p>Eddie came to gather the shot birds, though the grass made it complicated to search. Biryuk pinpointed where the birds were and befriended Eddie. Eddie asked his father’s permission to keep Biryuk for the meantime, his father said that the dog will make a good pointer.
</p><p>Eddie followed Biryuk to where he was hiding and he noticed that Biryuk’s eye was pierced from the stick his sister used. With rage piling up more and more he screamed, he walked towards their house when Berto called Eddie to show him a large centipede that almost bit him. Eddie killed the centipede and kept its shell.
</p><p>He used <strong>the centipede</strong> to get back to his sister who was embroidering in the house. He tossed the white handkerchief towards his sister then she shrieked back. Her sister did see that it was Eddie who did it, as she struggles to keep her breathing she collapsed. And then Eddie panicked and insisted that<strong> the centipede</strong> was already dead.
</p><p>Eddie’s bad memory of his sister Delia:
</p>When Eddie came inside his sister’s playhouse and broke her doll, she grabbed a sapling and hit Eddie over and over.
She told Berto to kill Eddie’s monkey because it smiled at her.
She made Eddie’s pigeon house destroyed for kindling because it stank.
She burned his butterfly collection because she said it was attracting ants.

                        <p>Eddie is a little kid who often gets picked on by his sister. He describes a time when he went into her dollhouse and broke one of her dolls and she got so angry that she fell down, foaming at the mouth, and had to go to the hospital.
Ever since then, the family has to be calm around her and work at not angering her or inspiring any extreme emotion because she has a weak heart. So Eddie takes it. He takes it when she complains about his pigeons and they have to let them go.  He cries, but doesn't retaliate when she burns his butterflies. He says nothing when she asks that his monkey be killed because it is mocking her.  He tells of a hunting trip with his father when they first met a dog that he adopts, and how it has helped him since, how he hangs out with it every day, why it is important to him. And one day he sees his sister beating it with a stick.  
He says nothing, because he shouldn't upset her, but his hatred is building from all the times that she has been cruel to him and destroyed the things that he loves. She tells him that if he allows it in the house again she will have the workman kill it, because it ruined her slippers. He runs after the dog, calling it.  
He finally gets close enough to see it, though it won't come to him or allow him to touch it, and he sees that his sister has punctured the dog's eye.</p><br />
