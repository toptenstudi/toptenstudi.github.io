The data and other evidence along with the question and answer choices lead you tothe conclusion.3. Conclusion is not a summary of the researchers' findings.4. The purpose of results section is to present and illustrate the findings.5. Make the conclusion section a completely subjective report of the results, and useall interpretation for the discussion.6. Conclusions provide a context, such as by describing the question that was addressedby making a particular observation.7. Conclusion does not describe results of control experiment.8. Conclusion includes observations that are not presented in a formal figure or table.9. The conclusion to be drawn should not come from the indirect implications of thestudy.10. Conclusion section should not be stated in a way that reader will in no way doubtthe correctness of the entire research study.11. Recommendations should follow logically from discussions of the findings andconclusions.12. Your recommendations should be placed in the same order as the conclusions.13. The recommendations may be summarized according to the groups to which they aredirected.14.A recommendation report is a paper that compares two or more products or solutionand makes a recommendation about which is the best option and recommends a course ofaction.15. A recommendation report proposes few potential solutions to a problem and concludesby recommending the best one.16. Recommendation reports are overtly persuasive since they make a final recommendationthat is informed by research and evidence.17. A recommendation report does not propose multiple solutions to a problem andrecommends the best one.18. All recommendation reports address a real and important problem.19. Recommendation reports sometimes require in-depth research that can range fromconducting interviews and surveys to reading peer-viewed journal articles or otherrelated documents.20. Your recommendation section should not be justified with what you have found inconclusions and you can't recommend something without first of all making adecision.The Subject is Practical Research 1​</a>

Identify variables (for example, amount of amount of coffee) that you need to control in order to have a fair test. 3. Identify the dependent and independent variables. 4. List all the materials you need, including the amount. 5. Do your investigation using the proper measuring devices. Be sure to record your observations and tabulate them. Write everything you observed during the dissolving test. These observations are the evidence from which you can draw your conclusions. 6. What is your conclusion? Does coffee dissolve faster in cold or in hot water? Use the observations and results you recorded to explain your answer 7. Does your conclusion support or reject your hypothesis? Explain your results.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Placing used tires in the sea, regardless of the intention, can have both positive and negative impacts on the marine environment.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>One potential positive impact is that the used tires can create artificial reefs that provide a habitat for marine life. These reefs can help support the growth of fish populations and other marine organisms, and they can also provide a destination for recreational divers and fishermen.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>However, there are also significant negative impacts associated with this practice. As the tires degrade, they can release chemicals and toxins into the water that are harmful to marine life. The tires can also trap and entangle marine animals, causing injury or death. Additionally, the tires can cause damage to natural reefs and other marine habitats.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>While the creation of artificial reefs can have some benefits for the marine environment, the negative impacts of placing used tires in the sea outweigh any potential benefits. Therefore, this activity should be stopped and alternative methods should be explored to support the growth of marine populations and habitats. These alternatives could include the creation of artificial reefs using environmentally friendly materials, or the restoration of natural reefs and other marine habitats that have been damaged by human activity.</strong></p><br />
