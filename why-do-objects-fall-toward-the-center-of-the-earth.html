                            3. Why do objects fall toward the center of the earth</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The answer is gravity: an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's gravity is what keeps you on the ground and what makes things fall. ... So, the closer objects are to each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is. Earth's gravity comes from all its mass.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Because of gravity. Gravity is dependent on the mass of a body,however the mass isn't the size of the body,it's how much it weighs. So while a neutron star may be smaller than Earth,it had far more mass then Earth,and even the sun(it has a high amount of density meaning a lot of matter packed into one area). Though don't be mistaken,it isn't the core that causes gravity,it is all the matter added together that causes gravity. A common misconception is that it's celestial bodies that have gravity and it's caused by the core but the reality is,all matter has gravity. Even you produce gravity. It's just that things with such little mass have a lot less gravity. However there are examples of things like huge asteroids having very small meteors orbit them or crash into them because of being pulled in.</strong>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Objects fall towards the center of the earth because of the force we called Gravitational force or Gravity. Gravity attracts falling objects on Earth that accelerate downward towards the center. In short, it is the gravity that makes the objects fall when dropped. Since gravity holds us to the ground and gives us weight. Hence this force is responsible for pulling us towards the earth.</p><p>2. It is easy to slip when there is water on a smooth floor due to the scientific word we called friction. Friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. The water acts as a lubricant and reduces the friction between your feet and the floor. The friction between your feet and the floor changes from kinetic to static friction. And that's why it is easy to slip when there's a wet floor.</p><p></p><p>I hope it helps if it does pls give me my thanks so I can be notified to help you!! &lt;3</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is all due to gravity. Gravity is a force that causes matter to be attracted towards each other.

                        <p><strong>1. The answer is (A) a force.</strong></p><p>Gravity is a force that pulls objects with mass toward each other. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. The answer is (A) Increases.</strong></p><p>If the moon is closer to the Earth, the gravitational force between them will increase. This is because gravity is directly proportional to the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the distance between them.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. The answer is (D) More force will be needed.</strong></p><p>Moving against gravity requires more force than moving with gravity or not moving at all. This is because gravity is always pulling objects towards the Earth's center, and moving against this force requires additional force to overcome it.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. The answer is (C) Fruit falling from the tree.</strong></p><p>Gravity causes objects to be pulled towards the Earth's center, which is why fruit falls from trees. A rolling ball may slow down and stop due to friction or other forces while applying brakes to stop a vehicle involves the use of friction, not gravity. Lighting a matchstick does not involve gravity at all.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5. The answer is (C) It pulls objects toward the ground.</strong></p><p>Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other, and on Earth, it pulls objects toward the ground.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>6. The answer is (C) Gravity.</strong></p><p>Gravity is what causes objects to fall toward the Earth's center. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s².</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>7. The answer is (B) Car.</strong></p><p>The gravitational force acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass. Therefore, it would be most difficult to lift a car against gravity compared to a ball, chair, or pen.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>8. The answer is (C) It is moving toward the pull of gravity.</strong></p><p>When a bicycle is traveling downhill, it is moving toward the pull of gravity, which accelerates the bicycle and increases its speed. When traveling uphill, the bicycle is moving against the pull of gravity, which slows it down.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>9. The answer is (D) It pulls us to the Earth's center.</strong></p><p>Gravity is what keeps us on the surface of the Earth, as it pulls us towards the Earth's center. The force of gravity on us is proportional to our mass.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>10. The answer is (C) Gravity.</strong></p><p>Gravity is the force that pulls us toward the Earth's center, making it necessary to overcome this force when jumping. Air and friction may also affect the jump, but gravity is the primary force that must be overcome. Weight is the measure of the gravitational force acting on an object, so it is not a force itself.</p><br />
