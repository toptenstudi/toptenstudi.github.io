Many famous musical compositions have a memorable melody or theme.</p><p><strong>Melodies </strong>can be derived from various scales (families of pitches) such as the  traditional major and minor scales of tonal music, to more unusual ones such as  the old church modes (of the Medieval and Renaissance periods: c. 500–1600), the  chromatic scale and the whole tone scale (both used in popular and art-music  styles of the late 19th and 20th-century periods), or unique scale systems devised in  other cultures around the world.
</p><p><strong>Melodies</strong> can be described as:
</p><p>• CONJUNCT (smooth; easy to sing or play)
</p><p>• DISJUNCT (disjointedly ragged or jumpy; difficult to sing or play).
