Choose whether frequency or relative frequency. 1. Report on smartphones with the least satisfactory rating so that the seller has a basis on what phone to sell. 2. Report on enrollees per grade level in DepEd Schools to be used as a basis of each Schools Division Office on the number of modules to be distributed. 3. Report on COVID-19 cases per province so that the National Government will have a basis on how to divide a budget for COVID -19 cases to different provinces. B. Determine which measure of central tendency is appropriate to use in making the following reports. 4. Daily Meal Allowance of leamers in a school to be used by the canteen manager to plan for a daily menu. 5. Daily waste material of a community during the month of January. 6.
