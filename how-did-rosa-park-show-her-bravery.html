                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rosa Parks (1913—2005) helped initiate the civil rights movement in the United States when she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955. Her actions inspired the leaders of the local Black community to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Led by a young Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted more than a year—during which Parks not coincidentally lost her job—and ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Over the next half-century, Parks became a nationally recognized symbol of dignity and strength in the struggle to end entrenched racial segregation.</p><br />

                            26. How did Rosa Parks’s family establish foundations for her courageous choice on the bus?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rosa Parks (1913—2005) helped initiate the civil rights movement in the United States when she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955. Her actions inspired the leaders of the local Black community to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Led by a young Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted more than a year—during which Parks not coincidentally lost her job—and ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Over the next half-century, Parks became a nationally recognized symbol of dignity and strength in the struggle to end entrenched racial segregation.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope its help<br />#brainlist</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>She wouldn't be motivated to do the things she did to help us find us equal. She gave it a chance for life and death and color.</p><p><strong>The year was 1955 and the United States of America was in a state of racial unrest. In Montgomery, Alabama, African American citizens were being treated unfairly by the local bus company for not giving up their seats to white people. This led to a boycott of the buses which lasted for 381 days until December 21st when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus and was arrested for doing so. This event sparked off many other events that eventually led to civil rights movements across America and changed the way people thought about race relations forever.</strong></p><p></p><br />
