                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>1. Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology.</p><p>2.There are a number of steps that are followed before a genetically modified organism (GMO) is created. Genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert, modify, or delete. The gene must then be isolated and incorporated, along with other genetic elements, into a suitable vector. This vector is then used to insert the gene into the host genome, creating a transgenic or edited organism. The ability to genetically engineer organisms is built on years of research and discovery on how genes function and how we can manipulate them. Important advances included the discovery of restriction enzymes and DNA ligases and the development of polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.</p><p>3.Tackling and Defeating Diseases.</p><p>Getting Rid of All Illnesses in Young and Unborn Children.</p><p>Potential to Live Longer.</p><p>Produce New Foods.</p><p>Organisms Can be 'Tailor-Made'</p><p>Faster Growth in Animals and Plants.</p><p>Pest and Disease Resistance. </p><p>4.Two to five players each represent a different god, and compete with each other to take over the world. ...
