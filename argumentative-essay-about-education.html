                            3. argumentative essay about gender equality and women's impowerment in education ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Gender equality and women's empowerment in education are crucial components of a just and equitable society. Despite significant progress made in recent years, many women still face significant barriers to accessing education and realizing their full potential. In this essay, I will argue that gender equality and women's empowerment in education are essential for building a fair and equal society.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, women's education is crucial for their personal and professional growth. Education provides women with the necessary skills and knowledge to participate fully in their communities and society as a whole. It allows women to access better job opportunities and provides them with greater economic independence, which, in turn, leads to improved overall quality of life. Education is also vital for women's health and well-being, as educated women are more likely to make informed decisions about their health and have healthier families.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, gender equality and women's empowerment in education contribute to the overall development of society. Educated women are more likely to be engaged in their communities and are better able to participate in civic activities such as voting and advocating for their rights. They are also more likely to raise educated and healthy children, which can have a positive impact on future generations.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the importance of women's education, many women still face significant barriers to accessing education. Discrimination, poverty, and cultural norms are just a few of the many factors that prevent women from receiving an education. In many parts of the world, girls are expected to prioritize domestic responsibilities over education, while in others, girls are married off at a young age, effectively ending their education. Moreover, women and girls are also more likely to face violence and harassment in educational settings, which further deters them from seeking education.</p><p></p><p>To achieve gender equality and women's empowerment in education, there needs to be a concerted effort to address the root causes of these barriers. This requires a multi-faceted approach that includes policy changes, increased investment in education, and the elimination of discriminatory practices and cultural norms. Governments should prioritize education as a fundamental human right and invest in programs that provide access to education for women and girls. Educational institutions should also create safe and inclusive environments that do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or violence.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, gender equality and women's empowerment in education are crucial for building a fair and equitable society. Women's education is not only essential for their personal growth and development but also contributes to the overall development of society. To achieve this, there needs to be a concerted effort to eliminate the barriers that prevent women and girls from accessing education. It is only through investing in education and ensuring equal access to it that we can build a better, more just, and equal world.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            4. ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ABOUTskills vs knowledge in education Introduction:Body:Conclusion:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is an important factor in the development of any person. It is the way we acquire knowledge and skills that will eventually help us become successful in our lives. However, the debate between skills and knowledge in education is a common one. Which should be emphasized in order to ensure success and fulfillment? </p><p></p><p>One argument in favor of knowledge is that it is what helps people gain the skills needed to excel in life. Knowledge gives us a base of understanding which can be applied in practical situations. This allows us to gain the ability to think critically and solve problems confidently. With knowledge, people can gain the ability to analyze data and apply theories in various contexts. This kind of understanding is what gives us the means to efficiently manage and perform the tasks that come our way. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, skills are an important part of education since they are essential to success in life. This is because skills provide us with the capability of doing something effectively and efficiently. Skills involve direct actions and involve the application of knowledge into practice. This can involve anything from problem solving, to communication and collaboration, or to being able to multitask. Skills allow us to be adaptable and creative when faced with different challenges, which is necessary in this ever-changing world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is clear that both skills and knowledge are necessary in education. Knowledge provides a solid foundation of understanding which can then be transferred into applicable skills. With knowledge, people can gain the understanding needed to solve analytical problems, while skills are what will help them put them into practice. As such, education should emphasize both of these aspects in order to ensure success and fulfillment. Only through the combination of knowledge and skills can students attain the abilities they will need to be competitive and successful in life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps </p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Academic integrity has been put into danger amidst the Covid 19 pandemic. It has become easier for students to undermine their academic honesty, such as copying others’ outputs, using the web during the tests, and asking surrogates to attend and produce their academic tasks such as assignments.</p><p></p><p>The transition to online evaluation of students’ outputs put immense pressure on teachers with insufficient time for curriculum adjustment. Many academic institutions had hope that everything would be the same as normal but things had gone the other way. The debate of intellectual honesty changed as face-to-face invigilated assessments were either online invigilated or converted to non-invigilated evaluations. Academic developers quickly prepared online academic integrity tools for teachers while finding ground in proven evidence-based concepts of academic integrity. However, despite the efforts of academic institutions, academic dishonesty had become rampant. Hence, it was a challenge for teachers how to appropriately give marks to the outputs of the students.</p><p></p><p>pa follow salamat</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines, there are currently over 2 million learners with disabilities enrolled in public and private schools across the country. These learners are entitled to special education services to help them succeed in their academic pursuits. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of special education services has been severely impacted, leading to a decline in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is the lack of access to technology and the internet. With the implementation of distance learning, learners with disabilities who do not have access to the necessary technology and internet connection are at a disadvantage. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of learners with disabilities who are able to participate in online classes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the lack of training and resources for teachers who are tasked with providing special education services. Many teachers are not equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide effective online special education services. This has resulted in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities being compromised.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing inequalities in the education system. Learners with disabilities from low-income families are particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This further widens the gap in the quality of education between different groups of learners.</p><p></p><p>In light of these challenges, it is imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic. This includes providing learners with disabilities with the necessary technology and internet connection, as well as providing teachers with the training and resources they need to effectively deliver special education services online. Additionally, more support should be given to learners from low-income families to ensure that they are not left behind.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic has brought to light the challenges facing special education in the Philippines. It is crucial that the government takes action to address these challenges and ensure that learners with disabilities are not left behind. By providing the necessary support and resources, we can ensure that all learners have access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Study hard,hope it help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is an important factor in the development of any person. It is the way we acquire knowledge and skills that will eventually help us become successful in our lives. However, the debate between skills and knowledge in education is a common one. Which should be emphasized in order to ensure success and fulfillment? </p><p></p><p>One argument in favor of knowledge is that it is what helps people gain the skills needed to excel in life. Knowledge gives us a base of understanding which can be applied in practical situations. This allows us to gain the ability to think critically and solve problems confidently. With knowledge, people can gain the ability to analyze data and apply theories in various contexts. This kind of understanding is what gives us the means to efficiently manage and perform the tasks that come our way. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, skills are an important part of education since they are essential to success in life. This is because skills provide us with the capability of doing something effectively and efficiently. Skills involve direct actions and involve the application of knowledge into practice. This can involve anything from problem solving, to communication and collaboration, or to being able to multitask. Skills allow us to be adaptable and creative when faced with different challenges, which is necessary in this ever-changing world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is clear that both skills and knowledge are necessary in education.

                        <p>As this challenging academic term begins, and some students are learning remotely, while others are heading back in person, we urge educators to pause and reflect on what worked — and didn’t — during remote learning last spring. While we eagerly await the moment when all schools can safely resume in person, we strongly caution against reverting back to the “normal” way of doing things. “Normal” was not working for so many students prior to COVID-19.</p><p></p><p>Since this remote learning experiment of 2020 upended typical school schedules and traditional approaches to teaching and learning, educators now have an opportunity to leverage key lessons and insights gained during this time to build a new normal that better supports student well-being, equity, and engagement with learning for all students during the next semester and beyond.</p><p></p><p>At Challenge Success, a school reform nonprofit affiliated with Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education, we know that any school change process should begin by listening to the stakeholders who matter most — the students. So we reached out to some of the high school students who have participated in the Challenge Success School Program and asked what worked (or not) during remote learning and what they would like school leaders to know about their experiences last spring.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CARRYONLEARNING</p><br />

Sex is a natural part of life, and when questions arise, they can be discussed in a matured way without condoning certain behavior. Relying to that, we realize that sex education is important to be inserted in a person’s life. Therefore, sex education in high schools is very necessary for youngsters to acquire information, form attitudes, beliefs and values about identity, relationships and intimacy. Sex education also encompasses sexual development, affection, body image and gender roles. In other words, it is about learning how we grow, reproduce and change over the years. It also includes a positive view of sex and the safety involved on sexuality. Regarding to the importance of sex education, I want to state my stand here that I strongly agree that “High schools must provide young people with adequate sex education because ignorance can be harmful”.</p><p></p><p>Sex education in high schools helps young people to be more prepared for life changes such as puberty, menopause and aging. Sex education can develop skills and self esteem to help students enter adolescence. It helps them in knowing that the sudden few changes are okay and normal.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Being educated doesn't only mean attaining the degree you always wanted to get.

It helps us to achieve our dreams, to learn new things, and to enhance our skills and knowledge. That is why we should take our studies seriously. Our performance in school reflects who we are.

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected education globally, including special education. In the Philippines, where special education is still a developing field, the pandemic has highlighted the need for further improvements in the sector. Despite some positive developments, the state of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is still inadequate.</p><p></p><p>One positive development in the Philippines is the increased awareness and attention given to special education during the pandemic. The government has launched various initiatives, including the provision of assistive technology and online training for teachers to support students with special needs. Additionally, the Department of Education (DepEd) has released guidelines for distance learning for students with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>However, these initiatives fall short in addressing the needs of all students with special needs in the country. For instance, the provision of assistive technology has been limited and not enough to support all students with disabilities. Additionally, online training for teachers is not enough to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with different learning needs.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exposed the already existing challenges in special education in the Philippines. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the government has failed to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to education. Many students with disabilities face barriers to enrollment, such as lack of transportation, inaccessible classrooms, and insufficient support services. The pandemic has only made these challenges more evident, with many students with disabilities unable to access distance learning materials and services.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some progress has been made in the field of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic, the state of special education is still inadequate. The government must do more to address the barriers to education faced by students with disabilities, including the provision of more assistive technology and support services, and the improvement of teacher training. Only then can students with special needs receive the education they deserve, even during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sex education at schools should begin as early as possible, starting in grade 3 or 4, introducing the primary concepts of sexual development. In this way, sex education can help children be more confident in their sexual development and apply safety measures to avoid risks and negative effects of early sexual activity.</p><br />

In the other way its effective because students are safe at home and teachers too. Therefore its both effective and not effective.</strong></p><strong>or this one</strong><p><strong>While countries are at different points in their COVID-19 infection rates, worldwide there are currently more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries affected by school closures due to the pandemic. In Denmark, children up to the age of 11 are returning to nurseries and schools after initially closing on 12 March, but in South Korea students are responding to roll calls from their teachers online.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>With this sudden shift away from the classroom in many parts of the globe, some are wondering whether the adoption of online learning will continue to persist post-pandemic, and how such a shift would impact the worldwide education market.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Even before COVID-19, there was already high growth and adoption in education technology, with global edtech investments reaching US$18.66 billion in 2019 and the overall market for online education projected to reach $350 Billion by 2025. Whether it is language apps, virtual tutoring, video conferencing tools, or online learning software, there has been a significant surge in usage since COVID-19.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>For those who do have access to the right technology, there is evidence that learning online can be more effective in a number of ways. Some research shows that on average, students retain 25-60% more material when learning online compared to only 8-10% in a classroom. This is mostly due to the students being able to learn faster online; e-learning requires 40-60% less time to learn than in a traditional classroom setting because students can learn at their own pace, going back and re-reading, skipping, or accelerating through concepts as they choose.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong># carry on learning </strong></p><p><strong># brainly.ph</strong></p><p><strong># pa brainliest how click the crown done thank you i need it pls  </strong></p><br />

                        <p>Advantages</p><p></p><p>Modern technology is mostly seen as a blessing for learners. The widespread use of mobile devices and the internet have made learning easier.</p><p></p><p>Here are a few advantages of modern technology in education:</p><p></p><p>• Independent learning has become easier and more effective</p><p></p><p>The internet can provide you with information in any field. No matter what you need to know, you can easily find that online. You can not always trust the data and the source, but you can still use them as educational resources. Students can use the internet without the assistance of their teachers or parents.</p><p></p><p>• Good preparations for the future</p><p></p><p>It is pretty obvious that learning in the future will be technology-based. Students who are using technology now will find it easy to compete in the future. That is why students should be encouraged to collaborate and communicate using digital technology.</p><p></p><p>• Modern technology has lowered tuition and textbook prices</p><p></p><p>More resources are available now, and those resources are easily accessible. Students are now less dependent on textbooks, and as a result, the cost of textbooks has decreased. Many learners are not buying physical textbooks. Rather, they are now using e-books.</p><p></p><p>and etc.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages</p><p></p><p>It is also important to remember that modern technology is not an unmixed blessing for students. The main allegation against digital devices is that these devices are making students lazy. Now we are going to discuss the disadvantages of modern technology.</p><p></p><p>• Lack of interest in hard work</p><p></p><p>Due to the availability of all types of information online, many students are now becoming lazy. They no longer want to study the hard way. Some students even do not attend classes, mistakenly thinking that everything can be found online. They think that teachers are no longer necessary.</p><p></p><p>• Misuse of technology</p><p></p><p>Mobile devices, computers, and other technologies are usually seen as tools of entertainment, not of education. Textbooks are known as just tools for learning. This is the teaching of consumerism, and it has a negative effect on students.</p><p></p><p>• Instructional challenges</p><p></p><p>Professors and teacher, if not trained regularly, often fail to instruct their students. Teachers who are used to teach in traditional methods sometimes cannot stay abreast with technology. Some teachers shun technology because they do not find it convenient to use technology.</p><br />
