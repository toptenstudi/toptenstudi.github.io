Write your answers in your Activity Notebook/ Activity Sheets. 1. Qualitative research uses inductive approach to test theory. 2. The researchers in quantitative type of research must focus on a specific research question that can be addressed in the study. 3. In quantitative research, it requires a careful review of the research literatures and developing hypotheses that frequently come from social theory. 4. The questionnaires or experiments will be employed in quantitative study. 5. Quantitative Research involves counting or measuring and often statistical tests are applied to detect or confirm tendencies. 6. Probability or non-probability sampling approaches in quantitative study are required from the researchers before drawing a sample size. 7. Using questionnaire is one of the most popular tools for the quantitative research.​</a>

                                            Directions: Read a debate piece to identify pure opinions by answering the questions that followDebate Topic: Replacing textbooks with tablets in schoolsPro Debater: My personal view is that mandating to replace textbooks with tablets will be beneficial since it poses littledisadvantages. Tablets increase standardized test scores. A research study, conducted in Auburn, Maine, showed thatkindergarten students using iPads scored much higher on literacy tests than students that did not use the device. I think,this is the primary advantage of using tablets over books.Aside from that, tablets cost 50%-60% less than textbooks. According to the FCC, the U.S. spends about $7 billion peryear on textbooks, but many of them are seven to ten years out of date. Advocates claim that using tablets instead willsave money and improve learning.Personally, and practically speaking, tablets are lighter than textbooks, as well. Between studying, homework, andextracurricular activities, going back to school may make kids feel like they have the weight of the world on theirshoulders. And sometimes, they literally do. After you pile a lunch, school supplies, binders, and textbooks - whichtypically weigh 3.5 lbs. each-into a child's backpack, the load he or she is fugging around could be huge .. andpotentially dangerous. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least 14,000 children are treatedfor backpack-related injuries every year.Questions:1. What is the opinion of the debater on replacing books with tablets? Identity words or phrases that reveal thedebater's opinion/s about it.​</a>

                            9. Directions: Read a debate piece to identify pure opinions by answering the questions that followDebate Topic: Replacing textbooks with tablets in schoolsPro Debater: My personal view is that mandating to replace textbooks with tablets will be beneficial since it poses littledisadvantages. Tablets increase standardized test scores. A research study, conducted in Auburn, Maine, showed thatkindergarten students using iPads scored much higher on literacy tests than students that did not use the device. I think,this is the primary advantage of using tablets over books.Aside from that, tablets cost 50%-60% less than textbooks. According to the FCC, the U.S. spends about $7 billion peryear on textbooks, but many of them are seven to ten years out of date. Advocates claim that using tablets instead willsave money and improve learning.Personally, and practically speaking, tablets are lighter than textbooks, as well. Between studying, homework, andextracurricular activities, going back to school may make kids feel like they have the weight of the world on theirshoulders. And sometimes, they literally do. After you pile a lunch, school supplies, binders, and textbooks - whichtypically weigh 3.5 lbs. each-into a child's backpack, the load he or she is fugging around could be huge .. andpotentially dangerous. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least 14,000 children are treatedfor backpack-related injuries every year.Questions:1. What is the opinion of the debater on replacing books with tablets? Identity words or phrases that reveal thedebater's opinion/s about it.​</h2><br />

I strongly disagree with the debater stand because using gadgets too much is dangerous, gadgets such as mobile phones, tablets, and computer desktops can cause physical and mental damage to children. According to a study, a child will likely to become overweight and develop seizure and vision problems when they spend too much time using gadgets.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation:I hope it will help </p><p></p><br />
