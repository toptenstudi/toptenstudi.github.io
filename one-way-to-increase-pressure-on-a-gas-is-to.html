                                            Let’s Try Directions: Read the paragraph carefully. Afterward, answer the following questions. Why a can of soda explodes if left outside on a hot sunny day A can of soda explodes when left in the sot sun because the pressure of the can increases due to the increase in temperature, eventually making the can explode due to the pressure being too high. In the online simulation, the volume of the contained was kept constant to represent a can. Gas was pumped into the container until the pressure was 1.5 atm. When the temperature is increased to from 300k to 500k, the pressure to 2.9 atm increased. When the temperature increased from 500k to 900k, the pressure increased to 5.5atm from 2.9 atm. At 1050k, the container exploded and released the gas after the pressure built to over 6 atm. According to Gay- Lussac’s Law, when volume is held constant, as it was in the case of the soda can, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. This means as temperature increases, pressure increases, and when temperature decreases, pressure decreases. If a soda can left out in the hot sun, the temperature inside the can will continually increase, causing the kinetic energy to increase. This causes the particles to move faster and hit the walls more often., increasing the pressure. Over time the pressure continues to increase as the temperature increases, eventually reaching too high of a pressure causing the can to explode. Reasonable Risk-taking Part of my Philosophy is that a life worth living involves taking reasonable risks, whatever that may mean to a person. Without that openness, responsiveness, a person sees very little possibility for change and can sink into a rut of routines. I have known many who define themselves by their routines-and little else. These are the people an American educator spoke of when he said, “Many people should have written on their tombstones: “Died at 30, buried at 60.” How sad! I think that one of the most horrible feelings a person must have is to be on the deathbed, regretting the many things never tried, and many things done that cannot be undone. I live my life to minimize possibilities of regrets, as I hope you do. Did you ever see that Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days? She plays an alcoholic in a destructive relationship with a guy who wants only to have fun. A staff person at the clinic where she is sentences to spend 28 days for her rehab explained: “Insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting different results.” Maybe more people should watch that movie. The world may not go out of its way to help you-the world does not owe us fairness-but the world is there with more possibilities than most of us imagine. If we are responsible to ourselves- and response-able, we can continue growing in the directions that are good for us. We do not need to understand the future, which, after all, does not exist, has not yet been created A.

                        Three Ways to Increase the Pressure of a Gas
<strong>Increase gas quality.</strong> In the equation this is expressed by "n." Adding more gaseous molecules increases the amount of collisions between the container's molecules and walls. This heightens the strain.
<strong>Raising the gas temperature.</strong> In the equation this is expressed by "T." Rising temperatures add energy to the molecules of air, increasing their movement and, again, increasing collisions.
<strong>Dismantle the gas capacity</strong>. In the equation that is the "V." Gasses can be compressed by their very nature, and if the same gas can be packed into a smaller jar, a greater pressure would be exerted. The gas molecules are forced to move closer together, through collisions (force) and heat.

                            13. Let’s Try Directions: Read the paragraph carefully. Afterward, answer the following questions. Why a can of soda explodes if left outside on a hot sunny day A can of soda explodes when left in the sot sun because the pressure of the can increases due to the increase in temperature, eventually making the can explode due to the pressure being too high. In the online simulation, the volume of the contained was kept constant to represent a can. Gas was pumped into the container until the pressure was 1.5 atm. When the temperature is increased to from 300k to 500k, the pressure to 2.9 atm increased. When the temperature increased from 500k to 900k, the pressure increased to 5.5atm from 2.9 atm. At 1050k, the container exploded and released the gas after the pressure built to over 6 atm. According to Gay- Lussac’s Law, when volume is held constant, as it was in the case of the soda can, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. This means as temperature increases, pressure increases, and when temperature decreases, pressure decreases. If a soda can left out in the hot sun, the temperature inside the can will continually increase, causing the kinetic energy to increase. This causes the particles to move faster and hit the walls more often., increasing the pressure. Over time the pressure continues to increase as the temperature increases, eventually reaching too high of a pressure causing the can to explode. Reasonable Risk-taking Part of my Philosophy is that a life worth living involves taking reasonable risks, whatever that may mean to a person. Without that openness, responsiveness, a person sees very little possibility for change and can sink into a rut of routines. I have known many who define themselves by their routines-and little else. These are the people an American educator spoke of when he said, “Many people should have written on their tombstones: “Died at 30, buried at 60.” How sad! I think that one of the most horrible feelings a person must have is to be on the deathbed, regretting the many things never tried, and many things done that cannot be undone. I live my life to minimize possibilities of regrets, as I hope you do. Did you ever see that Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days? She plays an alcoholic in a destructive relationship with a guy who wants only to have fun. A staff person at the clinic where she is sentences to spend 28 days for her rehab explained: “Insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting different results.” Maybe more people should watch that movie. The world may not go out of its way to help you-the world does not owe us fairness-but the world is there with more possibilities than most of us imagine. If we are responsible to ourselves- and response-able, we can continue growing in the directions that are good for us. We do not need to understand the future, which, after all, does not exist, has not yet been created A.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1:An argument is a line of reasoning designed to prove a point. ... Regardless of length and complexity, all arguments have the same basic framework: the author states some central idea, and then presents supporting evidence, laying it out in a logical pattern. The central point of an argument is called the conclusion.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>b</p><p>Inquiry.</p><p>Conviction.</p><p>Persuasion.</p><p>Negotiation.</p><p>Primarily, argument has two purposes: argument is used to change people's points of view or persuade them to accept new points of view; and argument is used to persuade people to a particular action or new behavior.</p><br />
