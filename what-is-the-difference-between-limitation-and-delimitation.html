                            4. 1. How is delimitation different from limitation? A. Delimitation refers to what the researcher decided to exclude in the study while limitation refers to the constraints that cannot be avoided by the researcher. B. Delimitation would include the demographic variables in the study while the limitation would refer to the settings and population of the study. C. The delimitation refers to the parameters of the study while limitation refers to the boundary of the study. D. Both A and C 2. Why is the scope and delimitation important in a research study? A. The scope and delimitation allow the conceptualization of a thorough research paper. . B. The scope and delimitation help the researchers to have focus on their study. C.

                            6. DO I NEED TO DO LIMITATION AND DELIMITATION IN ONE RESEARCH OR ONLY ONE OF THEM?​</h2><br />
                        <p>You need to do both limitation and delimitation in one research. Limitations are factors that may influence the results of a study, such as sample size, resources available, or the scope of the research. Delimitations are factors that are chosen by the researcher to limit the scope of the study, such as time frame, population, or location. Both of these factors are important to consider when conducting a research study.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Delimitations aim to narrow the scope of a study. For example, the scope may focus on specific variables, specific participants, specific sites, or narrowed to one type of research design (e.g., ethnography or experimental research). Limitations, however, aim to identify potential weaknesses of the study.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Limitations are influences that the researcher cannot control. ... Delimitations are choices made by the researcher which should be mentioned.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The scope of the difference between Islam and Christianity includes their distinct beliefs, practices, and rituals, as well as their respective historical, social, and cultural contexts. This may cover a wide range of topics such as the concept of God, the role of Jesus and Muhammad, religious texts, moral codes, prayer and worship practices, religious holidays, and social norms.</p><p></p><p>The delimitation of this topic, however, should recognize that the diversity within each religion and the nuances of their respective interpretations and practices cannot be fully captured in a brief discussion. Additionally, any comparison between Islam and Christianity should be approached with respect and sensitivity to avoid oversimplification or stereotyping. It is also important to note that any discussion of religious differences should be conducted in a manner that promotes mutual understanding and respect, rather than perpetuating religious bias or conflict.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Scope and Delimitation:</p><p></p><p>This study aims to examine the differences between Islam and Christianity. It will provide an overview of the two religions, including their beliefs, practices, and customs. The study will focus on the differences in the fundamental beliefs of the two religions, including their views on God, prophets, and the afterlife. It will also examine the religious practices and customs of Muslims and Christians, such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.</p><p></p><p>The study will be limited to the comparison of Islam and Christianity and will not cover other religions. It will also focus on the basic principles and teachings of the two religions and will not delve into the different sects and denominations within them. The study will be based on secondary sources, such as books, articles, and online resources, and will not involve primary research. Finally, the study will not aim to promote or discredit any particular religion but will provide an objective comparison of the two religions.</p><p></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
