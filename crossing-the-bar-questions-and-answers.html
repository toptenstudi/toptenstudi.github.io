                                            Identify the type of foreshadowing used in the following and explain what event it foreshadows.
1. In the early episodes of Game of Thrones, Viserys Targaryen appears to be a major threat – he is the son of the Mad King, and obsessed with conquering the Westlands and reclaiming his father’s throne. However, Viserys doesn’t make it past the first season; he is immediately killed after upsetting Khal Drogo. We soon realize that his sister, Daenerys, is the real threat.
2.There have been a series of lost belongings in class.  The students believe that the one who is getting their things is the classmate who is the most timid and the loner whom no one wants to befriend because he is the only poor among them.
3.Throughout the novel, Pip believes his benefactor is Miss Havisham, and for good reason. Too many coincidences and people around her became close to Pip during his time in London. However, in the end, he learns it was his convict.
4. Pip is given the conditions of his expectations from Jaggers. He stated that Pip may not inquire by any means who his benefactor is, until the time they choose to reveal themselves.
5. An old man is seated at his desk looking at his stamp collection.  When he opens the drawer for his magnifying glass, his fingers brush against a revolver.  He finds the magnifying glass and closes the drawer.
6.Pip mentions that the stranger in the bar stirred his drink with a file. This foreshadowed a connection with the first convict, who the reader later learns is Pip's benefactor.
7. It was the first time Mary’s husband has been very late for coming home.  She was very worried because he never answers her phone call.  When she opens her curtain, the night is so dark and only the flashing lightning is the source of light.
8.The scene is on a Wild West saloon.  The hero walks in and orders whiskey.  Over the corner, the villain watches him drink.  As the hero leaves, the villain spits on the floor.
9.In the first episode of Firefly, the crew accidentally take a Federal agent on board, and have to figure out which of their passengers it is. All clues point to Simon Tam, a mysterious figure who asks lots of questions and refuses to discuss his reason for being on the ship. However, it turns out Simon is not the agent – rather, he is a fugitive from the law, which explains his unwillingness to talk openly about his past.
10.When a fortune-teller looks into her crystal ball, she closes her eyes and crosses herself.</a>

                        <p>Crossing the bar is a <strong>poem</strong> by Alfred Lord Tennyson. </p><p>     A metaphorical meditation on death in which the speaker likens passing through the sandbar between a coastal region and the larger sea or ocean to dying or passing through it in a particular way</p><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>What significance does the phrase "clear call" have to the poet, according to your analysis of Crossing the Bar?What wishes does the poet have for his last journey?What does it mean to be "moaning"?What is the bar the poet is attempting to cross?Why does he want to cross the bar?<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p> The poet claims that the sun setting is a direct invitation for him to return to his true home, which is life after death.Tennyson writes about the sandbars, where the waves break. He utilizes it as a metaphor for a person's dying moments, when most individuals get depressed and seek to postpone their passing.The poet conveys his desire to depart without complaint or regret. Sandbars form near the mouths of rivers and harbors, and one must disturb and crush the sandbars in order to embark on a sea voyage.The only thing standing between the poet and the sea is a <strong>sandbar</strong>, which he longs to cross. Beyond him is a wide sea that has a known endpoint but an uncertain route. In order to cruise over the water without any interruptions or obstructions, he wants the sea level to rise.In order to continue his journey, he wants to cross the bar, before he arrives at his destiny and encounters God, his maker.<p>Learn about <strong>Poem: </strong>https://brainly.com/question/28565643</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                            10. Identify the type of foreshadowing used in the following and explain what event it foreshadows.
1. In the early episodes of Game of Thrones, Viserys Targaryen appears to be a major threat – he is the son of the Mad King, and obsessed with conquering the Westlands and reclaiming his father’s throne. However, Viserys doesn’t make it past the first season; he is immediately killed after upsetting Khal Drogo. We soon realize that his sister, Daenerys, is the real threat.
2.There have been a series of lost belongings in class.  The students believe that the one who is getting their things is the classmate who is the most timid and the loner whom no one wants to befriend because he is the only poor among them.
3.Throughout the novel, Pip believes his benefactor is Miss Havisham, and for good reason. Too many coincidences and people around her became close to Pip during his time in London. However, in the end, he learns it was his convict.
4. Pip is given the conditions of his expectations from Jaggers. He stated that Pip may not inquire by any means who his benefactor is, until the time they choose to reveal themselves.
5. An old man is seated at his desk looking at his stamp collection.  When he opens the drawer for his magnifying glass, his fingers brush against a revolver.  He finds the magnifying glass and closes the drawer.
6.Pip mentions that the stranger in the bar stirred his drink with a file. This foreshadowed a connection with the first convict, who the reader later learns is Pip's benefactor.
7. It was the first time Mary’s husband has been very late for coming home.  She was very worried because he never answers her phone call.  When she opens her curtain, the night is so dark and only the flashing lightning is the source of light.
8.The scene is on a Wild West saloon.  The hero walks in and orders whiskey.  Over the corner, the villain watches him drink.  As the hero leaves, the villain spits on the floor.
9.In the first episode of Firefly, the crew accidentally take a Federal agent on board, and have to figure out which of their passengers it is. All clues point to Simon Tam, a mysterious figure who asks lots of questions and refuses to discuss his reason for being on the ship. However, it turns out Simon is not the agent – rather, he is a fugitive from the law, which explains his unwillingness to talk openly about his past.
10.When a fortune-teller looks into her crystal ball, she closes her eyes and crosses herself.</h2><br />

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p><br />
