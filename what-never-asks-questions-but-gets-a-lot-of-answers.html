Please answer in complete sentences.Being a transferee is never easy. At first, I was hesitant to come, but my mother told me that I would find new friends in Masayahin Senior High School. I will never forget the day I first entered this school, I felt so shy and nervous. I did not know anyone because I was a new Grade 11 student. When I entered my first class looking for a chair to sit in, a boy sitting beside the window sill asked me,” Are you new in this school?” and I answered shyly,” Yes.” Then, he offered me a vacant seat beside him. He was Jasper, an old student in that school. We get along with each other well in our class. We worked on our assignments and school projects, he slept in our house doing our research work. After a year, we both realized that in many ways we had a lot of similarities in terms of interests in life. In the end, We became best friends.1. Where and when did the story happen?2.

                                            February 18, 2022FridayQUARTER 3Week 1Collaborative Learning Directions: Read the story carefully and answer the questions that follow.Punctuality is the Key to Success(Arsh Faisal)Once upon a time, there was a boy named Raheel who was 12 years old. Although he was a good child, used to helping others and respecting his elders, the only shortcoming he had was that he was not punctual, somehow, he always got late for things.Therefore, besides being a very hardworking student, Raheel was often sent back home from school because he would arrive late and any student who was frequently late would be sent home. This made Raheel upset because he missed his classes and he was only allowed to collect homework after school, which often made him confused as he didn’t know how to complete the assignments.Raheel didn’t realize that a student who is punctual always gets respect and social acceptance in the school and society and is admired by teachers as well as parents.It was no wonder that when Raheel was invited to attend his best friend’s birthday party, he arrived late, which made him miss the cake cutting and fun games everyone played. His best friend was upset at this and didn’t talk to Raheel.One day, there was a singing competition in his neighborhood, and he wanted to participate. Luckily, he got selected due to his good voice and he was so excited for the finale. His family and friends were thrilled as well and hoping that Raheel would win this competition.Finally, on the day of the competition, Raheel was so happy and could not wait to go. He had ironed his clothes, had a good breakfast, took shower, and looked fresh and confident. After more practice and rehearsal, Raheel got ready and was glad that he was going for the finale. But as his family was still getting ready therefore, Raheel thought to play a game on his PS4. He became so involved in his games that when his mother asked him to go, he told her to wait for five minutes as he was playing a match and didn’t want to lose. He did not even realize that being late could lead to disqualification from this competition. A lot of time passed and when his mother finally scolded him and asked him to turn off the game as they were leaving, he hurriedly shut the game and ran towards the car, but, unfortunately, they arrived just 10 minutes late and therefore, he didn’t get an entry as the participants had to be seated 15 minutes before the competition.Raheel was upset as his request to enter in the hall wasn’t approved by the judges and he was asked to leave.This made Raheel learn the lesson that time is very important, more important than money; if a person is not punctual, they will miss good opportunities in life. His parents forgave him for his carelessness and gave him another chance to be responsible and punctual and they were glad to see the change in him.Questions:1.

He forgot about the competition.c.	He became so involved in playing PS4.d.	He was stuck in traffic.4.	What realization did Raheel have after being disqualified from the singing competition?a.	He needs to spend more time in practicing.b.	He will always think positive.c.	He will never join any singing competition again.d.	He will give importance to time and will be always early.5.	What is the moral lesson of the story?​</a>

                                            Identify the type of foreshadowing used in the following and explain what event it foreshadows.
1. In the early episodes of Game of Thrones, Viserys Targaryen appears to be a major threat – he is the son of the Mad King, and obsessed with conquering the Westlands and reclaiming his father’s throne. However, Viserys doesn’t make it past the first season; he is immediately killed after upsetting Khal Drogo. We soon realize that his sister, Daenerys, is the real threat.
2.There have been a series of lost belongings in class.  The students believe that the one who is getting their things is the classmate who is the most timid and the loner whom no one wants to befriend because he is the only poor among them.
3.Throughout the novel, Pip believes his benefactor is Miss Havisham, and for good reason. Too many coincidences and people around her became close to Pip during his time in London. However, in the end, he learns it was his convict.
4. Pip is given the conditions of his expectations from Jaggers. He stated that Pip may not inquire by any means who his benefactor is, until the time they choose to reveal themselves.
5. An old man is seated at his desk looking at his stamp collection.  When he opens the drawer for his magnifying glass, his fingers brush against a revolver.  He finds the magnifying glass and closes the drawer.
6.Pip mentions that the stranger in the bar stirred his drink with a file. This foreshadowed a connection with the first convict, who the reader later learns is Pip's benefactor.
7. It was the first time Mary’s husband has been very late for coming home.  She was very worried because he never answers her phone call.  When she opens her curtain, the night is so dark and only the flashing lightning is the source of light.
8.The scene is on a Wild West saloon.  The hero walks in and orders whiskey.  Over the corner, the villain watches him drink.  As the hero leaves, the villain spits on the floor.
9.In the first episode of Firefly, the crew accidentally take a Federal agent on board, and have to figure out which of their passengers it is. All clues point to Simon Tam, a mysterious figure who asks lots of questions and refuses to discuss his reason for being on the ship. However, it turns out Simon is not the agent – rather, he is a fugitive from the law, which explains his unwillingness to talk openly about his past.
10.When a fortune-teller looks into her crystal ball, she closes her eyes and crosses herself.</a>

He was Jasper, an old student in that school. We get along with each other well in our class. We worked on our assignments and school projects, he slept in our house doing our research work.

February 18, 2022FridayQUARTER 3Week 1Collaborative Learning Directions: Read the story carefully and answer the questions that follow.Punctuality is the Key to Success(Arsh Faisal)Once upon a time, there was a boy named Raheel who was 12 years old. Although he was a good child, used to helping others and respecting his elders, the only shortcoming he had was that he was not punctual, somehow, he always got late for things.Therefore, besides being a very hardworking student, Raheel was often sent back home from school because he would arrive late and any student who was frequently late would be sent home. This made Raheel upset because he missed his classes and he was only allowed to collect homework after school, which often made him confused as he didn’t know how to complete the assignments.Raheel didn’t realize that a student who is punctual always gets respect and social acceptance in the school and society and is admired by teachers as well as parents.It was no wonder that when Raheel was invited to attend his best friend’s birthday party, he arrived late, which made him miss the cake cutting and fun games everyone played. His best friend was upset at this and didn’t talk to Raheel.One day, there was a singing competition in his neighborhood, and he wanted to participate. Luckily, he got selected due to his good voice and he was so excited for the finale. His family and friends were thrilled as well and hoping that Raheel would win this competition.Finally, on the day of the competition, Raheel was so happy and could not wait to go. He had ironed his clothes, had a good breakfast, took shower, and looked fresh and confident. After more practice and rehearsal, Raheel got ready and was glad that he was going for the finale. But as his family was still getting ready therefore, Raheel thought to play a game on his PS4. He became so involved in his games that when his mother asked him to go, he told her to wait for five minutes as he was playing a match and didn’t want to lose. He did not even realize that being late could lead to disqualification from this competition. A lot of time passed and when his mother finally scolded him and asked him to turn off the game as they were leaving, he hurriedly shut the game and ran towards the car, but, unfortunately, they arrived just 10 minutes late and therefore, he didn’t get an entry as the participants had to be seated 15 minutes before the competition.Raheel was upset as his request to enter in the hall wasn’t approved by the judges and he was asked to leave.This made Raheel learn the lesson that time is very important, more important than money; if a person is not punctual, they will miss good opportunities in life. His parents forgave him for his carelessness and gave him another chance to be responsible and punctual and they were glad to see the change in him.Questions:1.

                            7. Identify the type of foreshadowing used in the following and explain what event it foreshadows.
1. In the early episodes of Game of Thrones, Viserys Targaryen appears to be a major threat – he is the son of the Mad King, and obsessed with conquering the Westlands and reclaiming his father’s throne. However, Viserys doesn’t make it past the first season; he is immediately killed after upsetting Khal Drogo. We soon realize that his sister, Daenerys, is the real threat.
2.There have been a series of lost belongings in class.  The students believe that the one who is getting their things is the classmate who is the most timid and the loner whom no one wants to befriend because he is the only poor among them.
3.Throughout the novel, Pip believes his benefactor is Miss Havisham, and for good reason. Too many coincidences and people around her became close to Pip during his time in London. However, in the end, he learns it was his convict.
4. Pip is given the conditions of his expectations from Jaggers. He stated that Pip may not inquire by any means who his benefactor is, until the time they choose to reveal themselves.
5. An old man is seated at his desk looking at his stamp collection.  When he opens the drawer for his magnifying glass, his fingers brush against a revolver.  He finds the magnifying glass and closes the drawer.
6.Pip mentions that the stranger in the bar stirred his drink with a file. This foreshadowed a connection with the first convict, who the reader later learns is Pip's benefactor.
7. It was the first time Mary’s husband has been very late for coming home.  She was very worried because he never answers her phone call.  When she opens her curtain, the night is so dark and only the flashing lightning is the source of light.
8.The scene is on a Wild West saloon.  The hero walks in and orders whiskey.  Over the corner, the villain watches him drink.  As the hero leaves, the villain spits on the floor.
9.In the first episode of Firefly, the crew accidentally take a Federal agent on board, and have to figure out which of their passengers it is. All clues point to Simon Tam, a mysterious figure who asks lots of questions and refuses to discuss his reason for being on the ship. However, it turns out Simon is not the agent – rather, he is a fugitive from the law, which explains his unwillingness to talk openly about his past.
10.When a fortune-teller looks into her crystal ball, she closes her eyes and crosses herself.</h2><br />
