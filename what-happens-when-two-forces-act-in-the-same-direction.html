If you isolate the horse as system A and wagon as system B, you can identify these as action-reaction pair. F1 represents the force applied by the horse to the wagon and F2 represents the force applied by the wagon to the horse. Observe the direction and magnitude of these two interacting forces.

(hint: compare the length of the arrows exerted by the object to another.) _______________________________________________________________________________ p) With all of these, how can you describe what happens between two interacting systems? _______________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ The state of motion of an object is affected by the forces acting on it. The book is at rest because the net force (sum of all external forces acting on it) is zero (0). When the net force acting on a system is zero, it means that the external forces are balanced. This means that the object is either at rest or at constant motion. Forces can balance each other if they act on the same system. If, however, the forces are acting on two different systems, they will not cancel each other. ​</a>

The book is at rest because the net force (sum of all external forces acting on it) is zero (0). When the net force acting on a system is zero, it means that the external forces are balanced. This means that the object is either at rest or at constant motion. Forces can balance each other if they act on the same system. If, however, the forces are acting on two different systems, they will not cancel each other. ​</h2><br />
