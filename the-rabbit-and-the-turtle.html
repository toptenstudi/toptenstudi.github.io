                                            The Rabbit and the Turtle One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow. Much to the rabbit’s surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought. The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept going. However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him.Exposition :RISING Action:CLIMAX:Falling Action:​</a>

The rabbit covers a 30. m practice course in 5.0 seconds, the turtle covers the same distance in 120 seconds. If the actual raceis run on a 96 m course, by how many seconds will the rabbit beat the turtle?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>To solve this problem, we can first find the speed of the rabbit and the turtle:</p><p></p><p>Speed of rabbit = distance / time = 30 m / 5.0 s = 6.0 m/s</p><p>Speed of turtle = distance / time = 30 m / 120 s = 0.25 m/s</p><p></p><p>Next, we can use the speeds to find the time it takes for each animal to complete the actual race course:</p><p></p><p>Time for rabbit = distance / speed = 96 m / 6.0 m/s = 16 s</p><p>Time for turtle = distance / speed = 96 m / 0.25 m/s = 384 s</p><p></p><p>Finally, we can find the difference between the times to see how many seconds the rabbit will beat the turtle by:</p><p></p><p>Difference in time = time for turtle - time for rabbit = 384 s - 16 s = 368 s</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the rabbit will beat the turtle by 368 seconds, or about 6 minutes and 8 seconds</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the rabbit will beat the turtle by 368.0 seconds, or approximately 6 minutes and 8 seconds.</p><br />

                            30. AssessmentDIRECTIONS: Read the story carefully, then fill out the graphic organizer with thecorrect answers."The Rabbit and the Turtle"One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow. Much to the rabbit's surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was agood joke and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought. The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept going.However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him."

The tortoise wins the race by cunning while the hare fails because he overestimates himself and takes a nap during the race. The moral of the story is "slow and steady wins the race" which is incorporated in the game mechanic<p></p><p></p>I HOPE IT HELPS YOU EVEN IF ITS SHORT :)^-^#BRAINLIEST <br />
