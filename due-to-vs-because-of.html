                        <p>. Anchor man vs self conflict in characters’ past experiences
</p><p>A traumatic or misguiding past – a troubled backstory – is a common source of literary conflict. In many novels, we meet characters who are already on the path to winning or losing their inner conflict. [Find more of our best posts on backstory on our character writing hub.]
</p><p>
</p><p>Placing the origins of your characters’ inner struggles in their past experiences is useful because:
</p><p>
</p><p>They supply events and explanations you can reveal at your own pace.  These may be useful for introducing relevant secondary characters and conflicts
</p><p>You’re able to create psychological depth and realism. Your readers meet characters who have history, pasts, wounds, scars
</p><p>Let’s take a brief character study example that shows effective man vs self conflict:
</p><p>
</p><p>In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, early in the book the protagonist Rodion Raskolnikov murders a pawnbroker. The ex- law student is living in poverty in St Petersburg, when he decides to kill a pawnbroker he’s indebted to.
</p><p>
</p><p>The murder, the crime of the title, occurs early in the book. Yet Dostoevsky portrays Rodion as deeply conflicted and troubled. We read a portrait of a sensitive young man who is devoted to his mother and sister. Dostoevsky also shows how Rasksolnikov helps a poor woman whose husband is a drunk. He pays for the funeral – albeit with stolen money – when the man is trampled by a horse. Thus he is not a pure ‘villain’, but a complex, flawed character.
</p><p>
</p><p>Raskolnikov is torn between the desire to reward those he sees as ‘innocent’ in the world (the drunk’s wife) and those he sees as greedy, inhumane, opportunistic (the pawnbroker).
</p><p>
</p><p>Thus the conflict is psychological, as we see Raskolnikov justify the pawnbroker’s murder to himself by excluding the pawnbroker from the circle of people who are ‘innocent’ and thus worthy (in his eyes) of mercy.
</p><p>
</p><p>Why is this person vs self conflict effective?
</p><p>
</p><p>It’s relevant to the overarching story, arising from a character’s core goals and needs: Raskolnikov’s desperate need for money gives a clear motivation
</p><p>Even after the conflict reaches a peak, there are still intriguing unknowns: Will he be found out and arrested? How will his crime affect Rodion’s psyche?
</p><p>2. Create tension between winning and losing the battle
</p><p>Part of the pleasure of reading conflict-rich stories is our uncertainty – we want to know what happens.
</p><p>
</p><p>In person vs self story conflicts, it feels easy if a wave of a wand makes everything well. Even in Cinderella, after the fairy godmother helps Cinderella attend the prince’s ball in magical finery,
</p><p>there is a time-based conflict. We know she has to leave before the illusion – her magical clothing – fades.
</p><p>
</p><p>Uncertainties and complications can come from many sources:
</p><p>
</p><p>External interference: A character who battles addiction, for example, has a ‘bad influence’, partying friend
</p><p>Interpretation and framing: The stories they tell themselves, framing experiences, may influence whether their ‘good’ or ‘bad’ self wins. Raskolnikov justifies his murder to himself, even though he knows it is punishable legally, spiritually
</p><p>Circumstances beyond characters’ control: For example, a character who struggles with mental health and relies on medication for stability
</p><p>When Raskolnikov climbs the pawnbroker’s stairwell, he almost flees when he sees a nearby apartment is being painted.  Circumstances beyond the character’s control affect his ongoing struggle clearly.</p><br />

                        MORALITY AND IMPLICATIONS WITH THE LAWSituations and Citations<p><strong>1. Law vs. Ethics</strong></p><p>People cannot be made fair, kind, or honest by the law. For instance, while lying or breaking confidence is not against the law, they are immoral.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Lies, deception, and tricks Lies undermine public trust in law enforcement. Because they are an improper method to aim, lies are unethical.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Ethics vs. Psychology</strong></p><p>Ethics is the study of moral behavior. The study of human nature, experience, and thought processes is known as psychology. The relationship between psychology and ethics is one of a normative to a constructive science.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Ethics is the study of human behavior that adheres to certain ethical norms. Psychology can be used in the police force to manipulate and yield answers.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Ethics vs. Religion</strong></p><p>Religion has the power to inspire strong ethical impulses and to create high ethical standards.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Intimidation based on religion. intimidation based on religion. the exploitation of religion for profit. resource abuse in religion. Sects' financial manipulation.</p><p></p>IMPACTS OF MORALITY ON LAWThe moral tenets of society serve as the broad foundation for laws. Both control how an individual behaves in public. They significantly affect one another. For laws to be successful, those moral principles must be reflected in them.The law deals with a person's right to privacy, whereas morals are involved with the public perception of right and wrong. Law controls a man's conduct while he is a part of a certain community, but morals control a man's conduct even when he is by himself.<p></p><p><strong>Links about morality</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/16495593</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p></p><br />
