To compare similar/like fractions, compare the numerators just like whole numbers, i.e. the larger the 		numerator, the larger is the value of the fraction. ___________2. A bar when divided into 4 equal parts will have each piece smaller than when it is divided into 3 equal parts ___________3. The fraction is undefined if denominator is zero and numerator is non-zero; indeterminate, if both numerator 		and denominator are zeros. ___________4. If the ratio of passing grades to failing grades is 5 to 3, then out of 8 students, 3 are expected to fail. ___________5. In a direct proportion two variables, say x and y, varying such that as x increases, y also increases or as x 		decreases, y also decreases proportionally; that is, the ratio is always the same. ___________6. A whole is always bigger than its parts. __________7. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. __________8. To subtract similar fractions, we subtract the numerators and copy the denominators and reduced the fraction 		to lowest term, if needed. __________9. Rate is the part considered in its quantitative relation to the whole. __________10. When we convert fraction to decimal, we simply perform multiplication and then division ​</a>

Ang Histogram is a graphical display of data using vertical bars ofdifferent heights to represent the frequencies of the classes. It issimilar to bar graph but a histogram doesn't have any spacesbetween and groups numbers into ranges.It is used to summarize large data sets graphically and comparemeasurements to specifications.Histograms are a great way to show results of continuous data,such as: height, weight, and other related topics. But if the givendata is in categories, we should use bar graph instead.Note: Histogram should have the following parts:a. Titleb. Vertical axis - this indicates the frequency occurred within aninterval.c. Horizontal axis - this indicates the interval or scale of valuesinto which the measurement fit.d. Bars - it has two important characteristics, the height and width.The height represents the number of times the values within aninterval occurred. The width represents the length of the intervalcovered by the bar, and it is the same for all bars.ExampledTeacher Laura is making her quarterly grade summary, she wantsto present the number of students who obtained grades below75%, 75 - 79%, 80 - 84 %, 85-89%, and 90 - 100% using ahistogram.

                            9. True or False___________1. To compare similar/like fractions, compare the numerators just like whole numbers, i.e. the larger the 		numerator, the larger is the value of the fraction. ___________2. A bar when divided into 4 equal parts will have each piece smaller than when it is divided into 3 equal parts ___________3. The fraction is undefined if denominator is zero and numerator is non-zero; indeterminate, if both numerator 		and denominator are zeros. ___________4. If the ratio of passing grades to failing grades is 5 to 3, then out of 8 students, 3 are expected to fail. ___________5. In a direct proportion two variables, say x and y, varying such that as x increases, y also increases or as x 		decreases, y also decreases proportionally; that is, the ratio is always the same. ___________6. A whole is always bigger than its parts. __________7. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. __________8. To subtract similar fractions, we subtract the numerators and copy the denominators and reduced the fraction 		to lowest term, if needed. __________9. Rate is the part considered in its quantitative relation to the whole. __________10. When we convert fraction to decimal, we simply perform multiplication and then division ​</h2><br />

Ang Histogram is a graphical display of data using vertical bars ofdifferent heights to represent the frequencies of the classes. It issimilar to bar graph but a histogram doesn't have any spacesbetween and groups numbers into ranges.It is used to summarize large data sets graphically and comparemeasurements to specifications.Histograms are a great way to show results of continuous data,such as: height, weight, and other related topics. But if the givendata is in categories, we should use bar graph instead.Note: Histogram should have the following parts:a. Titleb. Vertical axis - this indicates the frequency occurred within aninterval.c. Horizontal axis - this indicates the interval or scale of valuesinto which the measurement fit.d.
