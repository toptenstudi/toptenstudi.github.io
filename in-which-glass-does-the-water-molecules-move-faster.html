Strike 1, strike 2
Come on let’s hit the table
For one and two
What you feel and what you hear?
Back and forth movement that’s
So real and clear.
They say it’s the vibration
Caused by energy in motion
Travelling in the S-L-G medium
With the gas in minimum
But not in a vacuum.
Sound energy, sound waves in the air
Causing disturbance anywhere
Particles vibrated
Compressed and expanded
Moving in longitudinal wave.
Crest or compression, trough or
rarefaction
That’s how the waves are in motion
Resembling valleys and hills
Like going uphill and downhill.
Boom, clank, tweet, bang
Sound can be loud, soft when sang
Greater, lesser, fast and slow
That’s what we know
Varying frequencies and vibrations.

 speed of sound ________.
 A. decreases 0.6 m/s every decrease of 1O C in temperature
 B. decreases 0.6 m/s every increase of 1O C in temperature
 C. increases 0.6 m/s every decrease of 1O C in temperature
 D. increases 0.6 m/s every increase of 1O C in temperature
_____11. How does an increase in temperature affect the speed of sound? As the
 temperature increases, the speed of sound _________.
A. decreases B. increases C. remains the same D. none of these
_____12. Why do sounds are more heard during warm days? It is because during warm
days the ___________.
A. kinetic energy is lower C. collision of air molecules is lower
B. kinetic energy is maintained D. collision of air molecules is greater
_____13. Why do sounds travel slower when the temperature of the medium is lower? This
 is because the particles of the medium ___________.
A. moves slowly C. moves very quickly
B. make more sound D. moves at the same speed
______14. In which temperature does sound travel slowest?
A. -10oC B. 10 oC C. -20oC D. 20 oC
______15. How does temperature of the medium affect the speed of sound? The warmer
 the medium, the _______ the sound travels through it.
 A. faster B. slower C. lower D. least</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. The water molecules are moving at the same speed in both glasses. There is greater internal energy in the glass that is full because it is a full glass therefore the IE is going to be twice as much. More heat will be required in the full glass because it has twice as much water to increase the temperature for.<p></p>2. There is greater internal energy in the full glass (twice the matter at the same temperature). More heat will be required to increase the temperature of the full glass by 1 Celcius degree, twice as much, in fact.<p></p>3. The internal energy of an ideal gas is therefore directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. ... The internal energy of systems that are more complex than an ideal gas can't be measured directly. But the internal energy of the system is still proportional to its temperature.<p></p> 4.   A. The water molecules are moving at the same speed in both glasses. There is greater internal energy in the glass that is full because it is a full glass therefore the IE is going to be twice as much.

However, because the amount of kinetic energy and potential energy in a system cannot be measured, therefore the amount of energy in a system cannot be determined, what can be determined is the amount of energy change in a system.</p><p> Changes in internal energy can be identified by measuring the heat (q) and work (w), which will occur when a system reacts.

Strike 1, strike 2
Come on let’s hit the table
For one and two
What you feel and what you hear?
Back and forth movement that’s
So real and clear.
They say it’s the vibration
Caused by energy in motion
Travelling in the S-L-G medium
With the gas in minimum
But not in a vacuum.
Sound energy, sound waves in the air
Causing disturbance anywhere
Particles vibrated
Compressed and expanded
Moving in longitudinal wave.
Crest or compression, trough or
rarefaction
That’s how the waves are in motion
Resembling valleys and hills
Like going uphill and downhill.
Boom, clank, tweet, bang
Sound can be loud, soft when sang
Greater, lesser, fast and slow
That’s what we know
Varying frequencies and vibrations.
