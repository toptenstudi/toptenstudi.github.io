                                            C. Nosebleeds Having a nosebleed is a common occurrence. Children experience epistaxis when blood flows out from either or both nostrils, often for a short period of time. It may be caused by one's behavior like frequent nose picking or blowing too hard when one has a cold. It may also be caused by certain physical factors such as an allergy or abnormal growths in the nasal cavity. Or it may be due to environmental conditions such as exposure to toxic fumes or dryness of the air. While it is often thought that holding one's head back can treat a nosebleed, this can actually cause one to choke or vomit. The best thing to do is to lean forward, pinch the top of the nose and apply a cold compress. And if that doesn't work, it's best to get professional help. 14.

                                            C. Nosebleeds 
Having a nosebleed is a common occurrence. Children experience epistaxis when blood flows out from either or both nostrils, often for a short period of time. It may be caused by one’s behavior like frequent nose picking or blowing too hard when one has a cold. It may also be caused by certain physical factors such as an allergy or abnormal growths in the nasal cavity. Or it may be due to environmental conditions such as exposure to toxic fumes or dryness of the air. While it is often thought that holding one’s head back can treat a nosebleed, this can actually cause one to choke or vomit. The best thing to do is to lean forward, pinch the top of the nose and apply a cold compress. And if that doesn’t work, it’s best to get professional help.

                            6. C. Nosebleeds Having a nosebleed is a common occurrence. Children experience epistaxis when blood flows out from either or both nostrils, often for a short period of time. It may be caused by one's behavior like frequent nose picking or blowing too hard when one has a cold. It may also be caused by certain physical factors such as an allergy or abnormal growths in the nasal cavity. Or it may be due to environmental conditions such as exposure to toxic fumes or dryness of the air. While it is often thought that holding one's head back can treat a nosebleed, this can actually cause one to choke or vomit. The best thing to do is to lean forward, pinch the top of the nose and apply a cold compress. And if that doesn't work, it's best to get professional help. 14.

                            19. C. Nosebleeds 
Having a nosebleed is a common occurrence. Children experience epistaxis when blood flows out from either or both nostrils, often for a short period of time. It may be caused by one’s behavior like frequent nose picking or blowing too hard when one has a cold. It may also be caused by certain physical factors such as an allergy or abnormal growths in the nasal cavity. Or it may be due to environmental conditions such as exposure to toxic fumes or dryness of the air. While it is often thought that holding one’s head back can treat a nosebleed, this can actually cause one to choke or vomit. The best thing to do is to lean forward, pinch the top of the nose and apply a cold compress. And if that doesn’t work, it’s best to get professional help.
