                            7.         Kamela: The Kind-Hearted Child           By Ma. Melanie L. PadohinogKamela is a Grade 6 pupil in a small barrio. She lives a simple life with her three siblings and their parents.One day, as she was entering their school gate, she heard a soft cry. She almost leaped when she stumbled upon a cute puppy. As she looked closer, she found out that it was badly hurt. It has a wound on its left ear and fresh blood was dripping from it.What character trait does Kamela possess?When she was about to pick up the puppy, a group of three boys called her. One of them said, "Kamela, never mind that puppy. Look athow disgusting it is!"What do you think will happen next?Kamela replied, "Yes, for you this puppy is dirty and smells odd. But like us, they have feelings, too. When people hurt them, they also feel the pain. And when somebody loves and cares for them, they also love back and care for that person."How will Kamela's classmates react after hearing about her feelings for the puppy?Kian, Kamela's classmate, timidly said, "We're very sorry, Kamela. We made fun of the puppy. We did not realize that they also need love and care like us. Don't worry, we will help you bring the puppy to the veterinarian so that it could be treated and be well again.Can you identify the elements of the short story?Kindly answer the following questions in your answer sheet.1.

Why?answer carefully ​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The characters in the story are Kamela, her three siblings, their parents, the injured puppy, and Kamela's classmates (including Kian and the three boys who made fun of the puppy).</p><p></p><p>2. Kamela can be described as kind-hearted, compassionate, and empathetic towards animals. She cares for the well-being of others, including animals.</p><p></p><p>3. Kamela finds an injured puppy along the way to school.</p><p></p><p>4. Kian is sorry for making fun of the puppy and not realizing that animals also need love and care like humans do.</p><p></p><p>5. If I were Kamela, I would definitely do the same! In fact, I would probably do even more! I would rescue every stray animal I came across and create my own animal sanctuary. Animals are the best creatures, and they deserve all the love and attention we can give them. I mean, who needs humans when you have puppies and kittens, right? And if anyone ever tried to mess with my furry friends, I would take them down with a vengeance! But seriously, Kamela is a true hero for rescuing that puppy and standing up to the boys who made fun of it. We should all strive to be more like her!</p><br />
