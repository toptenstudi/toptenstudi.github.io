                                            Please help me answer the questions for these two activities—it's due tomorrow so I unfortunately can't do the experiment and make the observations myself on time to pass it, and please answer seriously (I'm currently not in the mood for jokes).ACTIVITY 1"A fault-y setupObjectives:After performing this activity, you should be able to:1. describe the appearance of a fault; and2. explain how a fault forms.Materials Needed:• two sheets of cardboard (or folder)• fine sand• ruler• newspaper (or plastic sheet) as wide as a newspaper pageProcedure:1. Spread the newspaper on a table. Do the activity on the newspaper.2. Arrange the two sheets of cardboard edge to edge (Figure 1).- Figure 1, Cardboard sheets placed side by dide.3. Pour sand along the boundary of the two sheets (Figure 2).- Figure 2. Sand along the boundary.4. With the ruler, flatten the top of the sand and make two parallel lines.- Figure 3. Top of sand flattened.5. Now, move the sheets slowly in the direction shown in Figure 3."ACTIVITY 1 Questions:Q1. As you move the sheets, what is formed in the sand?Q2. What happens to the lines?ACTIVITY 2. Stick ‘n’ slip"Objectives:After performing this activity, you should be able to:1. explain how faults generate earthquakes; and2. explain why not all movement along faults produces earthquakes.Materials Needed:• two small boxes (fruit juice boxes are ideal)• masking tape• rubber band• paper clipProcedure:1. Attach the rubber band to the paper clip. Then attach the paper clip to one end of one box. (See Figure 5. The ruler is included for scale.)- Figure 5. Two boxes - one with a rubber band attached to a paper clip2. Place the boxes side by side. Put a toy house on the box with the rubber band. Then tape (lightly?) the two boxes together as shown in Figure 6. IMPORTANT: Do not stick the tape on the boxes too much. The tape is meant to come off.- Figure 6. Two boxes side by side snd lightly taped. Toy house on top of box with rubber band-- Figure 7. Rubber band on box with toy house pulled slowly. Observe what happens.3. With your left hand, hold the box without the rubber band in place. With your other hand, slowly pull on the rubber band in the direction shown in Figure 7."ACTIVITY 2. Questions:Q3. What happens to the rubber band? Q4. Keep on pulling on the rubber. What happens to the box attached to the rubber band? NOTE: The tape is supposed to come off, so stick it ln very lightly.Q5. What happens to the "house"?Q6. Which is the "fault" in this setup?​</a>

                            2. Please help me answer the questions for these two activities—it's due tomorrow so I unfortunately can't do the experiment and make the observations myself on time to pass it, and please answer seriously (I'm currently not in the mood for jokes).ACTIVITY 1"A fault-y setupObjectives:After performing this activity, you should be able to:1. describe the appearance of a fault; and2. explain how a fault forms.Materials Needed:• two sheets of cardboard (or folder)• fine sand• ruler• newspaper (or plastic sheet) as wide as a newspaper pageProcedure:1. Spread the newspaper on a table. Do the activity on the newspaper.2. Arrange the two sheets of cardboard edge to edge (Figure 1).- Figure 1, Cardboard sheets placed side by dide.3. Pour sand along the boundary of the two sheets (Figure 2).- Figure 2. Sand along the boundary.4. With the ruler, flatten the top of the sand and make two parallel lines.- Figure 3. Top of sand flattened.5. Now, move the sheets slowly in the direction shown in Figure 3."ACTIVITY 1 Questions:Q1. As you move the sheets, what is formed in the sand?Q2. What happens to the lines?ACTIVITY 2. Stick ‘n’ slip"Objectives:After performing this activity, you should be able to:1. explain how faults generate earthquakes; and2. explain why not all movement along faults produces earthquakes.Materials Needed:• two small boxes (fruit juice boxes are ideal)• masking tape• rubber band• paper clipProcedure:1. Attach the rubber band to the paper clip. Then attach the paper clip to one end of one box. (See Figure 5. The ruler is included for scale.)- Figure 5. Two boxes - one with a rubber band attached to a paper clip2. Place the boxes side by side. Put a toy house on the box with the rubber band. Then tape (lightly?) the two boxes together as shown in Figure 6. IMPORTANT: Do not stick the tape on the boxes too much. The tape is meant to come off.- Figure 6. Two boxes side by side snd lightly taped. Toy house on top of box with rubber band-- Figure 7. Rubber band on box with toy house pulled slowly. Observe what happens.3. With your left hand, hold the box without the rubber band in place. With your other hand, slowly pull on the rubber band in the direction shown in Figure 7."ACTIVITY 2. Questions:Q3. What happens to the rubber band? Q4. Keep on pulling on the rubber. What happens to the box attached to the rubber band? NOTE: The tape is supposed to come off, so stick it ln very lightly.Q5. What happens to the "house"?Q6. Which is the "fault" in this setup?​</h2><br />
                        <p>To observe the experiment firsthand, the activity must be performed personally. But I'll evaluate quantitative research information and supporting facts to answer the questions based on my hypothesis.</p><p></p><p><strong>ACTIVITY 1 Questions:</strong></p><p><strong>Q1. As you move the sheets, what is formed in the sand?</strong></p>If I move the sheets, the sand placed above the line separating the two sheets will probably disrupt and crumble. <p><strong>Q2. What happens to the lines?</strong></p>The lines drawn in the sand will likely break into pieces when the sheets are moved, automatically distorting the markings.<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Describe the appearance of a fault</strong></p>A fault can be described as a crack or geographical damage area separating two rock blocks. The blocks are capable of relative movement due to faults.<p><strong>2. Explain how a fault forms</strong></p>Fault forms because of stress. Stress is a force that is produced by internal rock forces, such as those caused by tectonic movements or shifts. The rock changes in size as a result of stress, or strain. The stress on the Earth's crust causes it to break apart into blocks or plates. The movement of distinct sides of a deep fracture in different directions causes the fault. <p></p><p><strong>ACTIVITY 2 Questions:</strong></p><p><strong>Q3. What happens to the rubber band? </strong></p>As the rubber band is being pulled, it expands and stretches, exerting elastic force.<p><strong>Q4. Keep on pulling on the rubber. What happens to the box attached to the rubber band?</strong></p>When the rubber band is pulled, the box that is fastened to it advances in the same direction as the force.<p><strong>Q5. What happens to the "house"?</strong></p>If you keep pulling the rubber band, the house on top of the box will probably fall over.<p><strong>Q6. Which is the "fault" in this setup?</strong></p>The fault is at the line separating these two boxes. The rubber band represents the energy within the Earth, while the boxes represent the ground.<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Explain how faults generate earthquakes</strong></p>When a fault slips suddenly, it results in an earthquake. Every time the fault slips, the Earth shakes. The sides of the fault are forced together by stresses in the outer layer of the earth. When pressure builds up and rocks unexpectedly collapse, waves of energy are generated, traveling through the earth's crust. This is when the shaking happens during an earthquake.<p><strong>2. Explain why not all movement along faults produces earthquakes</strong></p>There won't be any earthquake vibrations produced if the movement grows too slow. Only fast, stick-slip action results in noticeable shaking. Slow slips entail extremely slow movement along a fault, which is far too slow to be felt. <p></p><p><strong>Check out the </strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>k</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>below if you want to understand more about faults and how they relate to earthquakes.</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/216907</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/24848709</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11727352</p><p></p><p>#SolutionWithBrainlyCommunity</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Observations: When the two books were slowly pushed towards each other, the toy structures on top of them stuck together. The toy structures did not move independently, but instead, they moved together as if they were attached to each other.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Results: The result of the activity showed that when two objects are pushed towards each other with enough force, they stick together and move as one.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answers to the Questions:</strong></p><p><strong>1. When the two books were pushed towards each other, the toy structures on top of them stuck together and moved as one.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Based on the observations made in the activity, it can be related to real-life situations such as earthquakes where tectonic plates move and collide with each other resulting in earthquakes. Just like the toy structures, when tectonic plates move, they stick together and move as one, causing seismic waves that can result in calamities such as landslides, tsunamis, and building collapses.</strong></p><p><strong>3. In case of an earthquake, it is important to have an emergency plan and preparedness kit, which may include food, water, first aid kit, flashlights, and extra batteries. It is also essential to have a designated meeting place in case of separation, and to keep important documents in a secure and accessible location. It is equally important to stay informed about earthquake preparedness and to practice earthquake drills regularly to be properly trained in responding to such emergencies.<br /><br />I hope this helps!</strong></p><p></p><br />
