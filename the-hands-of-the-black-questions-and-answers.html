Then answer the questions.A dirty-yellow sky had threatened rain all day and a hollow stillness hung over the valley. Mother went to the field and gathered the last cucumbers and tomatoes. As she approached the house, she heard a frightening noise in a brush pile near the steps. Peering into the pile. she glimpsed a terrifying creature - a huge black monster with green head and giant green fangs. Mother's hands shook as she came up the steps dumped her apron and reached for her hoe. "Joe," she said struggling to steady her voice, "you go get Mr. Riley. "Jeanne, you stay in the house. I'm going out to stand guard at the brush pile until Mr. Riley gets here." It seemed an eternity before Mr. Riley arrived, scooped mother to one side, and pointed his shotgun into the brush pile. Then, quite suddenly, he lowered the gun and leaned down to take a better look."Is that your monster?" he asked mother gently, smiling and pointing into the brush. "Come here," he said. "And look closely at an ordinary black snake whose appetite is bigger than his mouth. That's a huge green frog, stuck half in and half out of his mouth. Those fangs are the frog's legs."That was when mother finally broke. Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she slumped forward. But Mr. Riley moved quickly enough to catch her small collapsing figure. And right then I knew that things could never be the same again.As thunder pierced the hollow stillness, I looked at mother and suddenly knew her secret. She was desperately afraid - and had been all along - of the foxes. the hawks, the snakes. But she had faced them anyway!

                                            KUNG SINO MAKA ANSWER JAN MAY 30 POINTSTungkung Langit was an industrious, loving, and kind god whose chief concern was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a lazy, jealous, and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their heavenly home, and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her long, jet-black hair all day long. One day, Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for sometime to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy onTungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it. Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a quarrel between them followed. Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In this rage, he divested his wife of powers and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.An excerpt from “How the World was Created” a Panayan FolktaleQuestions:1. Who are the main characters in the story?2.

                            6. PHAETHON was a youthful son of Helios who begged his father let him drive thechariot of the sun. The god reluctantly conceded to the boy's wishes and handed himthe reigns. But his inexperience proved fatal, for Phaethon quickly lost control of theimmortal steeds and the sun-chariot veered out of control setting the earth ablaze. Theplains of Africa were scorched to desert and men charred black. Zeus, appalled by thedestruction, smote the boy with a thunderbolt, hurling his flaming body into the watersof the River Eridanos. Phaethon's sisters, the Heliades, gathered on the banks and intheir mourning were transformed into amber-teared poplar trees.After his death Phaethon was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Auriga("the Charioteer"), or else transformed into the god of the star which the Greeksnamed Phaeth on--the planet Jupiter or SaturnThe name Phaethon means "the shining" or "radiant one from the Greekverb phaethó "to shine."FAMILY OF PHAETHONPARENTS(1.1) HELIOS(1.2) HELIOS &amp; KLYMENE(1.31 KLYMENOS &amp; MEROPE(PHAETHON - Son of the Sun-God of Greek Mythology 2017)Now answer the questions for processing!1.

                            25. Grade 7 Reading Comprehension TextMy Motherby Jeanne HillRead the passage. Then answer the questions.A dirty-yellow sky had threatened rain all day and a hollow stillness hung over the valley. Mother went to the field and gathered the last cucumbers and tomatoes. As she approached the house, she heard a frightening noise in a brush pile near the steps. Peering into the pile. she glimpsed a terrifying creature - a huge black monster with green head and giant green fangs. Mother's hands shook as she came up the steps dumped her apron and reached for her hoe. "Joe," she said struggling to steady her voice, "you go get Mr. Riley. "Jeanne, you stay in the house. I'm going out to stand guard at the brush pile until Mr. Riley gets here." It seemed an eternity before Mr. Riley arrived, scooped mother to one side, and pointed his shotgun into the brush pile. Then, quite suddenly, he lowered the gun and leaned down to take a better look."Is that your monster?" he asked mother gently, smiling and pointing into the brush. "Come here," he said. "And look closely at an ordinary black snake whose appetite is bigger than his mouth. That's a huge green frog, stuck half in and half out of his mouth. Those fangs are the frog's legs."That was when mother finally broke. Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she slumped forward. But Mr. Riley moved quickly enough to catch her small collapsing figure. And right then I knew that things could never be the same again.As thunder pierced the hollow stillness, I looked at mother and suddenly knew her secret. She was desperately afraid - and had been all along - of the foxes. the hawks, the snakes. But she had faced them anyway! No more would I be amazed at her fearlessness, but I would ever marvel at her enormous courage.Answer these questions:1. based on the story, what are the creatures mother is afraid of?a Foxes, cockroach and hawksb Foxes, hawks and snakesc Foxes, snakes and monstersd Foxes, snakes and ratsWhy do you think the mother faced her fears? a She needs to be strong to protect her kids b She needs to show them how to fight  c To become powerful in the futured To show that she is strong mentallyIn the story, Mother asked to get Mr. Riley.

                            27. KUNG SINO MAKA ANSWER JAN MAY 30 POINTSTungkung Langit was an industrious, loving, and kind god whose chief concern was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a lazy, jealous, and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their heavenly home, and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her long, jet-black hair all day long. One day, Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for sometime to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy onTungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it. Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a quarrel between them followed. Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In this rage, he divested his wife of powers and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.An excerpt from “How the World was Created” a Panayan FolktaleQuestions:1. Who are the main characters in the story?2.
