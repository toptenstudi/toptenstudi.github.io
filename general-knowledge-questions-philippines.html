                                                 Okay, we're gonna have this huge exam and apparently, there's gonna be general knowledge included in this exam. I thought; "If it's just general knowledge then I probably won't have a problem. But if it's PHILIPPINE general knowledge, then my life's as good as over." Why, I don't even know who the Philippine presidents are except for the first, the current, and the one before the current. Hey, don't blame me! I've listened in Hekasi class time, but you know why I know so little about this particular subject? It's becuase Filipino, for me, is so hard!!! My Filipino fluency level is that of a 5th grader! And no, I'm not in the least but interested in becoming fluent; I just need enough words to survive.
     Anyway, other than the presidents, can any of you tell me what questions they usually ask in the general knowledge portion? Like WHEN did the (insert important event here) happen, or WHEN was (insert important person here) born and when did he/she die, or something like that? Please, please, be specific.
 
Note: I'm rewarding 25 points (as you can clearly see) for whoever answers my question SPECIFICALLY and CORRECTLY. And if you can't really answer, then just point me to a USEFUL and very INFORMATIVE website.
P.S.: I was too lazy to type in Google *Philippine General Knowledge* and choose from hundreds of websites then reading and memorizing tons of things which I'm really not interested in learning. And I just wanted to test what this website can actually do.

                                            DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

                                            Based on the Severe Weather Bulletin # 3 issued at 05:00 PM today by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Typhoon "ROLLY^ prime prime will make landfall over Aurora Quezon Provinces on Sunday evening or Monday early morning, traverse Central Luzon and affect nearly the entirety of Luzon Island. Due to its trajectory, current severe intensity and potentially high-volume rainfall, "ROLLY^ prime prime can be expected to generate volcanic sediment flows or lahars, muddy streamflows or muddy run-off in rivers and drainage areas on the monitored active volcanoes of Mayon, Pinatubo and Taal. DOST-PHIVOLCS thus strongly recommends increased vigilance and readiness of communities in pre-determined zones of lahar and related hazards on these volcanoes.Prolonged and heavy rainfall may generate post-eruption lahars on major channels draining Mayon Volcano by incorporating loose material from remnant pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits from the January-March 2018 eruption. The bulk of erodible PDC deposits occupy the watershed areas of the Miisi, Mabinit, Buyuan and Basud Channels. In addition, older and erodible eruption deposits occupy the watershed areas on the eastern and western slopes of the edifice and can be remobilized as non-eruption lahars by erosion of banks and channel beds.. Mayon lahars can threaten communities downstream of the above channels with inundation, burial and wash away.Pinatubo lahars are likely be channel-confined and occur on the upper to middle reaches of the Sto.

                            3.      Okay, we're gonna have this huge exam and apparently, there's gonna be general knowledge included in this exam. I thought; "If it's just general knowledge then I probably won't have a problem. But if it's PHILIPPINE general knowledge, then my life's as good as over." Why, I don't even know who the Philippine presidents are except for the first, the current, and the one before the current. Hey, don't blame me! I've listened in Hekasi class time, but you know why I know so little about this particular subject? It's becuase Filipino, for me, is so hard!!! My Filipino fluency level is that of a 5th grader! And no, I'm not in the least but interested in becoming fluent; I just need enough words to survive.
     Anyway, other than the presidents, can any of you tell me what questions they usually ask in the general knowledge portion? Like WHEN did the (insert important event here) happen, or WHEN was (insert important person here) born and when did he/she die, or something like that? Please, please, be specific.
 
Note: I'm rewarding 25 points (as you can clearly see) for whoever answers my question SPECIFICALLY and CORRECTLY. And if you can't really answer, then just point me to a USEFUL and very INFORMATIVE website.
P.S.: I was too lazy to type in Google *Philippine General Knowledge* and choose from hundreds of websites then reading and memorizing tons of things which I'm really not interested in learning. And I just wanted to test what this website can actually do.

                            11. DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

Also, “sana ol”has been used with a variety of positive and negative traits, including, but not limited to,“envy’ or “jealousy”, “hopeful”, and “being positive”. The term continues to be useddifferently by many and can be considered a social construct unique language constructto all. These concepts gathered by the study may be used in future quantitative studiesto obtain more generalized opinions based on numerical data from a population sample.Guide Questions:1. What are the types of data gathered in the research abstract presented?2. What data collection methods are used in the study?3.

                            19. Based on the Severe Weather Bulletin # 3 issued at 05:00 PM today by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Typhoon "ROLLY^ prime prime will make landfall over Aurora Quezon Provinces on Sunday evening or Monday early morning, traverse Central Luzon and affect nearly the entirety of Luzon Island. Due to its trajectory, current severe intensity and potentially high-volume rainfall, "ROLLY^ prime prime can be expected to generate volcanic sediment flows or lahars, muddy streamflows or muddy run-off in rivers and drainage areas on the monitored active volcanoes of Mayon, Pinatubo and Taal. DOST-PHIVOLCS thus strongly recommends increased vigilance and readiness of communities in pre-determined zones of lahar and related hazards on these volcanoes.Prolonged and heavy rainfall may generate post-eruption lahars on major channels draining Mayon Volcano by incorporating loose material from remnant pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits from the January-March 2018 eruption. The bulk of erodible PDC deposits occupy the watershed areas of the Miisi, Mabinit, Buyuan and Basud Channels. In addition, older and erodible eruption deposits occupy the watershed areas on the eastern and western slopes of the edifice and can be remobilized as non-eruption lahars by erosion of banks and channel beds.. Mayon lahars can threaten communities downstream of the above channels with inundation, burial and wash away.Pinatubo lahars are likely be channel-confined and occur on the upper to middle reaches of the Sto. Tomas Marella and Bucao River systems but may transition to muddy streamflows and floods on the lower reaches and affect adjacent communities of San Marcelino, San Narciso, San Felipe and Botolan, Zambales Province. Muddy streamflows may likewise be generated along the O'Donnell and Pasig-Potrero River systems draining the Pinatubo edifice to the north and southeast, respectively and affect downstream communities in Tarlac and PampangaInstructions: (Knowledge, Understanding and Critical Thinking) Read the rubric or guide for assessing your scores, try to express your answer based on the given guideabove.

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras- Outstanding Universal Value The Rice Terraces of the Philippines Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far back as two millennia ago in the precolonici Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all the products of Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modemization.
