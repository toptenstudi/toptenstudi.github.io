Write your answers on a separate sheetof paperMeiosisThe process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division in which the number ofchromosomes is reduced by half. It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms. During molosishomologous chromosomes separate, and the haploid cells that form have only one chromosome from eachpair Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two cell divisionsare called melosis and melosis ILPhases of MeiosisMeiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase. In both meiosis I and melosis 1. cels go through the samefour phases as mitosis. However, there are important differences between meiosis and mitosis.Melosis1. Prophase The nuclear envelope begins to break down and the chromosomes condense. Controlesstart moving to opposite poes of the cell, and a spindle begins to forres. Importantly, Momologouschromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase L. In prophase of mitosis and melonis il homologouschromosomes do not form pairs in this way.2. Metaphoset Spindle fibers attach to the paired homologous chromosomes. The pared chromosomesline up along the equator of the cel. This occus only in metaphase L in metaphase of mitosis andmelosis it, it is sister chromolids that line up along the equator of the cell.3. Anaphase E Spindle fibers shorten and the chromosomes of each homologous poir start to separate from eachother. One chromosome of each pair moves toward one pole of the cell and the other chromosome movestoward the opposite pole4. Telophase I and Cyioldnesis The spindle breaks down and new nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm ofthe cel divides, and two haploid daughter cells result, the daughter cells each have a random assortment ofchromosomes, with one from each homologous poir. Both daughter cells go on to meiosis II.Melosis 111. Prophase Ill. The nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle begins to form in each haplold daughter cellfrom melossi. The centro es also start to separate,2. Metaphase It Spindle fibers line up the sister chromatids of each chromosome along the equator of the cell3. Anaphose ft Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.4. Telophose II and Cytokinesis: The spindle breaks down, and new nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm ofeach cell divides, and four haploid cells resuit. Each cell has a unique combination of chromosomes.1. Define meiosis2 Is the DNA replicated after meiosis why or why nors3.

Write your answers on a separate sheetof paperMeiosisThe process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division in which the number ofchromosomes is reduced by half. It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms. During molosishomologous chromosomes separate, and the haploid cells that form have only one chromosome from eachpair Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two cell divisionsare called melosis and melosis ILPhases of MeiosisMeiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase. In both meiosis I and melosis 1. cels go through the samefour phases as mitosis. However, there are important differences between meiosis and mitosis.Melosis1. Prophase The nuclear envelope begins to break down and the chromosomes condense. Controlesstart moving to opposite poes of the cell, and a spindle begins to forres. Importantly, Momologouschromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase L. In prophase of mitosis and melonis il homologouschromosomes do not form pairs in this way.2. Metaphoset Spindle fibers attach to the paired homologous chromosomes. The pared chromosomesline up along the equator of the cel. This occus only in metaphase L in metaphase of mitosis andmelosis it, it is sister chromolids that line up along the equator of the cell.3. Anaphase E Spindle fibers shorten and the chromosomes of each homologous poir start to separate from eachother. One chromosome of each pair moves toward one pole of the cell and the other chromosome movestoward the opposite pole4. Telophase I and Cyioldnesis The spindle breaks down and new nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm ofthe cel divides, and two haploid daughter cells result, the daughter cells each have a random assortment ofchromosomes, with one from each homologous poir. Both daughter cells go on to meiosis II.Melosis 111. Prophase Ill. The nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle begins to form in each haplold daughter cellfrom melossi. The centro es also start to separate,2. Metaphase It Spindle fibers line up the sister chromatids of each chromosome along the equator of the cell3.
