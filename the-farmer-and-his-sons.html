                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>ANSWER:</p><p></p><p>A farmer had five sons. They were strong and hardworking. But they always quarreled with one another. Sometimes, they even fought. The farmer wanted his sons to stop quarreling and fighting. He wanted them to live in peace. Plain words of advice or scolding did not have much effect on these young people. The farmer always thought what to do to keep his sons united. One day he found an answer to the problem. So he called all his sons together. He showed them a bundle of sticks and said, “I want any of you to break these sticks without separating them from the bundle.” Each of the five sons tried one by one. They used their full strength and skill. But none of them could break the sticks. Then the old man separated the sticks and gave each of them just a single stick to break. They broke the sticks easily. The farmer said, “A single stick by itself is weak. It is strong as long as it is tied up in a bundle. Likewise, you will be strong if you are united. You will be weak if you are divided.”  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if im wrong</p><p>pa brienliest po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>There are 20 goats and 30 chickens.<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>You can solve this question by drawing/illustration, counting, listing, along with other methods. Just make sure to use the method you're comfortable with. Goats have 4 legs and chickens have 2, so I started multiplying the number of legs by multiples of 10. I also made sure there were 50 animals. I started with 10 goats and 40 chickens which made 120 legs. Then I tried 20 goats and 30 chickens. This reached the needed answer. This was my answer because it reached 140 legs and 50 heads. Hope it helps! :) #CarryOnLearning</p><br />
