If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

                                            B Directions Compare and contrast how Cambodia and Myanmar preserve their respective cultures. Write your opinions consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion similar with the text presented below. Cambodia and Myanmar both have rich cultures. However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</a>

                                            Philippine society Philippine society is a unique blend of diversity and homogeneity. Although geographically part of Southeast Asia, the country is culturally strongly Euro-American. Forces of assimilation have constantly worked to overcome cultural differences between the various ethnic groups that are scattered—sometimes in relative isolation—throughout the archipelago. Nearly four centuries of Western rule, however, have left an indelible imprint on the Philippines, serving as a conduit for the introduction of Western culture and as the catalyst for the emergence of a sense of Philippine political and cultural unity. While the Christian churches built by the Spanish and the mosques built by the Muslims provided a spiritual anchor, the educational system established by the United States and expanded by the Filipinos has become emblematic of cultural unity and socioeconomic progress. Nonetheless, through the persistence of strong family ties, the revival of the barangay as the smallest unit of government, increased attention to Asian history and literature, and subsequent revival of dormant traditions, the Philippines has strengthened its Asian heritage without abandoning its Western cultural acquisitions.Hope this helps​</a>

The History of Philippine Journalism
Journalism in the Philippines has gone through a number of both setbacks and boosts. The history of Philippine journalism presented in this study is cited from “Journalism for Filipinos” by Malinao (2003). 
In the year 1637, the first Philippine Newsletter was published - the “Successos Felices” (Fortunate Events) of Tomas Pinpin, the father of Filipino printing.  Aside from Pinpin’s one-shot fling at journalism, the “Hojas Volantes” (Flying sheets) or Spaniards’ notice to the public, were widely distributed in the country for mass readership.

                                            History of the philippines
The history of the Philippines is known to have begun at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[2][3] The earliest known modern human was from the Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[4] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[5] By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians reached northern Philippines migrating southward from Taiwan.[6]
Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[7] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[8] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu[9] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is Mindoro or Laguna.[10]
These polities were either influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist[11] Indian religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy from India through many campaigns from India including the South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I,[12] Islam from Arabia, or were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[13][14] These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[15] The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming Dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.
The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[16][17][18] Spanish colonialism began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[19] Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain.
Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[20] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.</a>

In the Pre-Spanish period, literature was in oral form as technology of printing wasn’t available yet. Works such as epics, legends, folklore, salawikain, bugtong, sawikain, songs such as the Oyayi or Hele are passed on from generations to generations and they are still well-known up to this day as they are being taught in schools. Philippine Literature changed during the Spanish Period. It was centered on Christian faith. Pre-Spanish literary types continued to develop; however, there was a gradual shift of interest from nature and natural phenomena to the lives of the saints, hymns, miracles and invocations based on the teachings of the Catholic Church. The works during this time are imitative of the Spanish theme, forms, and traditions. The corrido, awit, dalit, cenaculo, moro-moro, duplo and karagatan, and zarzuela are reflective of the said characteristics. Religious matters were in prose as novenas and prayer books, biographies of the saints, tales and novels. The Filipinos were able to retain their native traditions and poems in the field of poetry reflected as lyrical folksongs and riddles. Some examples of songs are Bahay Kubo, kundiman, and tapat. Francisco Baltazar also was popular during this time because of his “Florante at Laura”. Events such as the exposure of the Filipinos to Europe’s liberal idealism, the opening of the Suez Canal, the Spanish Revolution in 1868, and the martyrdom of Gomburza led to Filipino nationalism. This gave birth to two movements during this time – the Propaganda movement and the Revolutionary movement. The Propaganda movement was reformatory in objective and its members are college students mostly based in Spain. The primary propagandists were Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Graciano Lopez-Jaena. The exposure of the evils of the Spanish rule in the Philippines was because of Rizal’s Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo and has paved the way to a revolution against Spain. Del Pilar’s essays and editorials in Diariong Tagalog which he founded with Lopez-Jaena’s articles in La Solidaridad which he was an editor reflected nationalism that was dominant at this time.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope that helps</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philippine literature withstood time and periods and has evolved through generations.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

                            5. B Directions Compare and contrast how Cambodia and Myanmar preserve their respective cultures. Write your opinions consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion similar with the text presented below. Cambodia and Myanmar both have rich cultures. However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</h2><br />

                            6. Philippine society Philippine society is a unique blend of diversity and homogeneity. Although geographically part of Southeast Asia, the country is culturally strongly Euro-American. Forces of assimilation have constantly worked to overcome cultural differences between the various ethnic groups that are scattered—sometimes in relative isolation—throughout the archipelago. Nearly four centuries of Western rule, however, have left an indelible imprint on the Philippines, serving as a conduit for the introduction of Western culture and as the catalyst for the emergence of a sense of Philippine political and cultural unity. While the Christian churches built by the Spanish and the mosques built by the Muslims provided a spiritual anchor, the educational system established by the United States and expanded by the Filipinos has become emblematic of cultural unity and socioeconomic progress. Nonetheless, through the persistence of strong family ties, the revival of the barangay as the smallest unit of government, increased attention to Asian history and literature, and subsequent revival of dormant traditions, the Philippines has strengthened its Asian heritage without abandoning its Western cultural acquisitions.Hope this helps​</h2><br />

Journalism in the Philippines has gone through a number of both setbacks and boosts. The history of Philippine journalism presented in this study is cited from “Journalism for Filipinos” by Malinao (2003). 
In the year 1637, the first Philippine Newsletter was published - the “Successos Felices” (Fortunate Events) of Tomas Pinpin, the father of Filipino printing.  Aside from Pinpin’s one-shot fling at journalism, the “Hojas Volantes” (Flying sheets) or Spaniards’ notice to the public, were widely distributed in the country for mass readership.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The word pensionado originated with the Spanish language. It means to receive a pension from the government. As the Pensionado Act started in 1903, the purpose was to "Educate and bind current and future Filipino leaders to the American colonial administration."[1] Filipinos, mostly males, that were sponsored by the act were able to continue their education abroad and learn about American culture.
</p><p>
</p><p>The United States government agreed to having Filipinos in the United States to acquire knowledge on Western culture and civilization. This program encouraged Filipinos to obtain education in the United States and return to the Philippines. The first year of the program there were about 20,000 applicants with only one hundred of Filipinos men ultimately selected to study abroad in the United States. About forty boys and eight girls were chosen each year in 1904 and 1905.[2] Students were spread across the United States to participate in higher education. ... The program, which ended in 1943 and sought to train future Philippine leaders in preparation for post-World War II independence, also fostered beliefs in the supremacy of U.S. institutions, language, and white culture as compared to traditional Philippine culture.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>hope this help you</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. History of the philippines
The history of the Philippines is known to have begun at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[2][3] The earliest known modern human was from the Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[4] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[5] By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians reached northern Philippines migrating southward from Taiwan.[6]
Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[7] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[8] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu[9] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is Mindoro or Laguna.[10]
These polities were either influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist[11] Indian religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy from India through many campaigns from India including the South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I,[12] Islam from Arabia, or were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[13][14] These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[15] The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming Dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.
The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[16][17][18] Spanish colonialism began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[19] Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain.
Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[20] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.</h2><br />
