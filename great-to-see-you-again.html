Grandfather leads the children to the animal shelter. The children see the livestock animals. The children are amused when grandfather makes an unusual sound to get the animals' attention.
The animals hurriedly move to the feeding area. Grandfather serves their forage right away. The young sheep look adorable in their white thick wooly coat.
But suddenly, Patricia shouts, horrified! Grandfather and CJ look at her questioningly. "A mouse runs over my feet," says Patricia. "It's just a mouse, Patricial" exclaims CJ. Grandfather and CJ laugh
at her.
"Come on! Let's go to the vegetable farm," invites Grandfather. The children are satisfied seeing the different rows of vegetables. They spend an hour helping Grandfather harvest some vegetables.
After a while, they go home contentedly, asking grandfather to take them again to the farm next time.
1. Where do Patricia and CJ go on Saturday morning?
2. What do they do there?
3. What is Patricia afraid of?
4. What are the things you are afraid of? How do you face your fear?

Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!" As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there, they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again, the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture; a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep. In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said. The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.Answer the following questions:1. What is the story all about?2. What was the purpose of the boy for pretending that there is a wolf?3. Did the villagers do something when the boy convinced them that there is a wolf?4. What happened to the boy upon knowing that he was giving out false information?5. How can you relate the story when it comes to public speaking?​</a>

The Shepherd Boy &amp; the Wolf By: Aesop A shepherd boy tended his master's sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the sheep and the quiet forest. He was thinking what he would do should he see a wolf. So, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His master had told him to call for help should a wolf attack the flock, and the villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!" 2 As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there, they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the shepherd boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again, the villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture; a wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the sheep. In terror the boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said. The wolf killed a great many of the boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest. Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth. 1. What is the title and who is the author of the story. Where did it happen? 2. What did the boy do to amuse himself? 3. What did his master tell him if there would be a wolf? 4. What trick did the boy played to the villagers? 5. Do you agree with what the boy did upon fooling the villagers? Why? Why not? 6. If you were the boy would you do the same trick? Why?​</a>

Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!" As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there, they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again, the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture; a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep. In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said. The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.Answer the following questions:1. What is the story all about?2. What was the purpose of the boy for pretending that there is a wolf?3. Did the villagers do something when the boy convinced them that there is a wolf?4. What happened to the boy upon knowing that he was giving out false information?5. How can you relate the story when it comes to public speaking?​</h2><br />

                            30. What will I do? Directions: Read the short story then answer the questions that follow. The Shepherd Boy &amp; the Wolf By: Aesop A shepherd boy tended his master's sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the sheep and the quiet forest. He was thinking what he would do should he see a wolf. So, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His master had told him to call for help should a wolf attack the flock, and the villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!" 2 As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there, they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the shepherd boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again, the villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture; a wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the sheep. In terror the boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said. The wolf killed a great many of the boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest. Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth. 1. What is the title and who is the author of the story. Where did it happen? 2. What did the boy do to amuse himself? 3. What did his master tell him if there would be a wolf? 4. What trick did the boy played to the villagers? 5. Do you agree with what the boy did upon fooling the villagers? Why? Why not? 6. If you were the boy would you do the same trick? Why?​</h2><br />
