A Homeless Man One day, I saw a homeless man in the subway. He was a little bit different from other homeless people. When he came into our car, he started making a speech about how hard he had tried to find a job, how difficult it was to do so, how hungry he was, and so on. Then, he sang a song with a sad low voice. It sounded pitifully throughout the car. Moreover, his speech was so persuasive that people could not help feeling sympathy. As a result, most people there gave him some change, or even a dollar. His paper cup was filled with money in a minute. The Educational System in Burma During my father's generation, the education system was very different. Back in those days, more schools were provided by the government. In those days, people had a better education than nowadays because teachers had different ways of teaching. Most of the students were taught by British teachers. Therefore, they spoke better English and had high standards in English. Also, they began learning English in primary school. Furthermore, all of the subjects were taught in English. The schools' rules were strictly followed, and the administrators had punishments for every little thing. Now, the educational system is far different from my father's. For example, all the subjects are taught in Burmese, except for English. I, myself, and other students started to learn English in the fifth grade. In the fourth and eighth grades, our final exams were given by the state board of education, and in the tenth grade, our exam was a nation-wide exam. In each grade, we have to pass every subject. Otherwise, we have to repeat that particular grade. Therefore, it can be really difficult to graduate from high school. After tenth grade, we can enter college. In the old days, there was no limit in choosing any major or professional field that students wanted. However, things are not as easy in my generation. The students have fewer opportunities to learn and fewer careers from which to choose​</a>

He was a little bit different from other homeless people. When he came into our car, he started making a speech about how hard he had tried to find a job, how difficult it was to do so, how hungry he was, and so on. Then, he sang a song with a sad low voice. It sounded pitifully throughout the car. Moreover, his speech was so persuasive that people could not help feeling sympathy. As a result, most people there gave him some change, or even a dollar. His paper cup was filled with money in a minute. The Educational System in Burma During my father's generation, the education system was very different. Back in those days, more schools were provided by the government. In those days, people had a better education than nowadays because teachers had different ways of teaching. Most of the students were taught by British teachers. Therefore, they spoke better English and had high standards in English. Also, they began learning English in primary school. Furthermore, all of the subjects were taught in English. The schools' rules were strictly followed, and the administrators had punishments for every little thing. Now, the educational system is far different from my father's. For example, all the subjects are taught in Burmese, except for English. I, myself, and other students started to learn English in the fifth grade. In the fourth and eighth grades, our final exams were given by the state board of education, and in the tenth grade, our exam was a nation-wide exam. In each grade, we have to pass every subject. Otherwise, we have to repeat that particular grade. Therefore, it can be really difficult to graduate from high school. After tenth grade, we can enter college. In the old days, there was no limit in choosing any major or professional field that students wanted. However, things are not as easy in my generation. The students have fewer opportunities to learn and fewer careers from which to choose​</h2><br />
