Anabaena is known to be toxic to fish.You design an experiment to test how much of the algae the fish can stand before they die. You obtain6 large aquariums (all the same size) and fill them with water taken from a healthy catfish pond at youroperation. You put each aquarium on the same bench in the laboratory, where the light andtemperature values are identical. You let the water stand for one day before starting the experiment.In aquarium 1, you add 2 grams of algae and no fish. In aquarium 2, you add 20 small catfish and noalgae. Aquarium 3 gets 20 catfish and 2 grams of algae, #4 gets 20 catfish and 4 grams of algae, #5 gets20 catfish and 8 grams of algae, and aquarium #6 gets 20 catfish and 16 grams of algae.

We want to find out the number of defectiveiPhone. Thus, to each outcome in the sample space we shall assign a value. These are0, 1, or 2. If there is no defective iPhone, we assign the number 0; if there is 1 defective iPhone, we assign the number 1; and 2, if there are two defective iPhone. The number of defective iPhone is a random variable. The possible values of this random variable are 0, 1, and 2.Read and analyze the given situation below. NlustrationLet D represent the defective iPhone and N for the non-defective iPhone. If we let y bethe random variable representing the number of defective iPhone, show the values of the random variable Y. Complete the table below to show the values of the randomvariable.

Write the relationship between the total number of mangoes to the number of kaing. _________________________________________________________3. Can 50 be replaced by another value? Why or why not? ___________________________________________________Since n can take on many different values, we say that n is a variable. its value varies. on the other hand, 4 is a constant since the number of kaing is a fixed value.please answer i really need it. tysm​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>How to Solve Quadratic Word Problems Part 3
</p><p>By Civil Service Reviewer on Jan 18, 2016 in Math Word Problems
</p><p>In the previous two posts (Part 1 and Part 2), we have discussed two problems involving quadratic equations. The first one is
</p><p>
</p><p>A rectangular flower garden with dimensions 3m by 7m is surrounded by a walk of uniform width. If the area of the walk is 11 square meters, what is the width of the walk in meters?
</p><p>
</p><p>Solution
</p><p>
</p><p>If we let x be the width of the walk, then the length of the walk becomes x + 7 + x = 7 + 2x and the width becomes x + 3 + x = 3 + 2x  as shown in the figure below.
</p><p>
</p><p>cs2
</p><p>
</p><p>We know that the area of the garden (the inner rectangle) is equal 7 \times 3 = 21 square meters. The area of the larger rectangle is equal to
</p><p>
</p><p>(3 + 2x)(7 + 2x) = 21 + 14x + 6x + 4x^2 = 21 + 20x + 4x^2.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, to get the area of the walk, we have to subtract the area of the garden from the area of the large rectangle. That is,
</p><p>
</p><p>area of the larger rectangle – area of the smaller rectangle = 11
</p><p>
</p><p>4x^2 + 20x + 21 - 21 = 11
</p><p>
</p><p>4x^2 + 20x = 11
</p><p>
</p><p>Subtracting 11 from both sides, we have
</p><p>
</p><p>4x^2 + 20x -11 = 0.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, the quadratic equation is not factorable, so we use the quadratic formula in order to find the value of x. In using the quadratic formula, we want to identify the values of a, b, and c in the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and substitute in the quadratic formula
</p><p>
</p><p>x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
</p><p>
</p><p>From the equation above, a = 4, b = 20 and c = -11. Substituting these values in the quadratic formula, we have
</p><p>
</p><p>x = \dfrac{-20 \pm \sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4(4)(-11)}}{2(4)}
</p><p>
</p><p>= \dfrac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 176}}{8}
</p><p>
</p><p>= \dfrac{20 \pm 24}{8}
</p><p>
</p><p>That means that we have two roots
</p><p>
</p><p>x_1 = \dfrac{-20 + 24}{8} = \dfrac{1}{2}
</p><p>and
</p><p>
</p><p>x_2 = \dfrac{-20 - 24}{8} = \dfrac{-44}{8} = \dfrac{-11}{2}.
</p><p>
</p><p>As we can see, we x_2 is not a possible root because it is negative. Therefore, the acceptable answer to the problem is
</p><p>
</p><p>x_1 = \dfrac{1}{2}.
</p><p>
</p><p>This means that the width of the walk is ½ meters.
</p><p>
</p><p>Check: If the width of the walk is ½ meters, then the length of the larger rectangle is 1/2 + 7 + 1/2 = 8 and the width is 1/2 + 3 + 1/2 = 4. The area is (8)(4) = 32 sq. m.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now the area of the walk is 21 meters and 32 - 21 = 11 sq. m. which is the area of the walk indicated in the problem. Therefore, we are correct.</p><br />

                            18. You are concerned about the rate of death in catfish your aquaculture operation in tanks that have ahigh amount of algae growth. You collect some of the algae and send it to the university to have itidentified. You find that it is a blue-green alga called Anabaena. Anabaena is known to be toxic to fish.You design an experiment to test how much of the algae the fish can stand before they die. You obtain6 large aquariums (all the same size) and fill them with water taken from a healthy catfish pond at youroperation. You put each aquarium on the same bench in the laboratory, where the light andtemperature values are identical. You let the water stand for one day before starting the experiment.In aquarium 1, you add 2 grams of algae and no fish. In aquarium 2, you add 20 small catfish and noalgae. Aquarium 3 gets 20 catfish and 2 grams of algae, #4 gets 20 catfish and 4 grams of algae, #5 gets20 catfish and 8 grams of algae, and aquarium #6 gets 20 catfish and 16 grams of algae. The aerationrate of each aquarium is identical. You make two observations at the same time each day for twoweeks. You keep track of the numbers of fish in each tank that die.1.

Lesson 3 Finding Possible Values of a RandomVariableWhat's NewTo understand how one finds possible values of random variables, do the activitybelow.Suppose two iPhone are tested at random. We want to find out the number of defectiveiPhone. Thus, to each outcome in the sample space we shall assign a value. These are0, 1, or 2. If there is no defective iPhone, we assign the number 0; if there is 1 defective iPhone, we assign the number 1; and 2, if there are two defective iPhone. The number of defective iPhone is a random variable. The possible values of this random variable are 0, 1, and 2.Read and analyze the given situation below. NlustrationLet D represent the defective iPhone and N for the non-defective iPhone. If we let y bethe random variable representing the number of defective iPhone, show the values of the random variable Y. Complete the table below to show the values of the randomvariable. The completed table should look like this. Possible OutcomesValue of the Random Variable Y (numberof defective iPhone)DD2NN0DN1ND1​</h2><br />
