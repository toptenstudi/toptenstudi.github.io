From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

 BEST MANGO
 There are many mango varieties in the Philippines. Champagne mango or
 carabao mango is probably the most famous in terms of taste. This mango variety
is the sweetest mango I ever tasted. It is also the mango variety that the
Philippines export to other countries. There are different breed produced from
Carabao mango-one of which is called Sweet Elena. This breed originated
somewhere in Zambales. Sweet Elena mango is the sweetest that I ever had. It is
probably the sweetest mango in the world. There is also the well-loved Cebu and
Guimaras mangoes are of world-class quality. Filipinos enjoy eating mango
regardless if it is green or ripe. The Pico mango or Manggang Pico is best eaten
regardless of its maturity. I enjoy eating green mangoes especially if it is extra sour.
Pico mango is my first choice whenever I want to eat Manggang Hilaw with
Bagoong. The Philippines holds the record for the world’s Biggest mango.

Theby the Philippine Tourism Promotions BoardPhilippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. Froma long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved a people ofa unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.2 The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kiashi,and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be takenfrom Malay forefathers. The close familyrelations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The prousness comes from the Spaniardin de thisintroduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and thisis what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Orientalone,By the Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizableby distinct traits and dialects – thesturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the centralplains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems ofMindanao. Tribal communities canbe found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.A Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and thesepeople can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christiandenominations and Buddhist.5 The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background ofthe people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well.

Most of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are native to South Asia,[1][2] from where the "common mango" or "Indian mango", Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics.

The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for are said to be taken from Malay forefathers.

Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one. (3) Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions. Each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayas from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. (4) Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 11l dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. (5) The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian demonstrations and Buddhist.​</h2><br />

At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

 BEST MANGO
 There are many mango varieties in the Philippines. Champagne mango or
 carabao mango is probably the most famous in terms of taste. This mango variety
is the sweetest mango I ever tasted. It is also the mango variety that the
Philippines export to other countries. There are different breed produced from
Carabao mango-one of which is called Sweet Elena. This breed originated
somewhere in Zambales. Sweet Elena mango is the sweetest that I ever had. It is
probably the sweetest mango in the world. There is also the well-loved Cebu and
Guimaras mangoes are of world-class quality. Filipinos enjoy eating mango
regardless if it is green or ripe. The Pico mango or Manggang Pico is best eaten
regardless of its maturity. I enjoy eating green mangoes especially if it is extra sour.
Pico mango is my first choice whenever I want to eat Manggang Hilaw with
Bagoong. The Philippines holds the record for the world’s Biggest mango.
