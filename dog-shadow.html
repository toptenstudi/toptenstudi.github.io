He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked theother Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped atin the water, because it was a shadow: and his own, because the stream swept itaway.After reading the story, choose the correct interrogative, where, when, why, how tofill in the blank which will help you identify the elements of the story,1. "thus, lost both answers the interrogative__2. "a bridge over a stream" answers interrogative.3.

                                            The dog and the shadowOneday, a dog had found a piece of meat and was carrying it home in its mouth to eat. on its way home it had to cross a running creek. As it crossed, it looked down in the water and saw its own shadow in the water. It thought the shadow was another dog with another piece of meat. It made up its mind to have that second piece of meat. So it started to hit the shadow with its mouth, but as it opened its mouth the piece of meat fell into the water and was never seen more. The dog went home sadly with no food to eat.moral➡️Don't be greedy.ayan po young kwento nasa picture ang sagot po Sana po masagot NYO Kung sino nakasagot po i-brainlest ko at i-follow ko​</a>

He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him.                                     A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.</p><br />
