                                            HYDROGENHELIUMITMERCURYAtomic emission spectraPhoto illustrated by Donnie Ray ObinaHow did Neils Bohr explain the spectral lines of an element shown in thespectroscope? Each line in the atomic spectra of elements suggest definite energytransformations within the atom. Bohr stated that electrons are moving around thenucleus in circular path or orbit at definite distances from the nucleus. This is similarto the planets revolving around the sun. Electrons in each orbit have definite energy.This energy increases as the distance of the orbit from the nucleus increases. Theseorbits are also known as "shells" or "energy levels" and are assigned each a number:n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. or letters (K, L, M, N, O, etc. ). As long as the electron stays in itsgiven orbit, there is no absorption or emission of energy. If the electron received extraenergy, it can jump into a higher energy level, this is also called excited state. Theelectron in the excited state can return to its original lower energy level or groundstate by releasing discreet amount of energy in the form of light​</a>

                            4. HYDROGENHELIUMITMERCURYAtomic emission spectraPhoto illustrated by Donnie Ray ObinaHow did Neils Bohr explain the spectral lines of an element shown in thespectroscope? Each line in the atomic spectra of elements suggest definite energytransformations within the atom. Bohr stated that electrons are moving around thenucleus in circular path or orbit at definite distances from the nucleus. This is similarto the planets revolving around the sun. Electrons in each orbit have definite energy.This energy increases as the distance of the orbit from the nucleus increases. Theseorbits are also known as "shells" or "energy levels" and are assigned each a number:n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. or letters (K, L, M, N, O, etc. ). As long as the electron stays in itsgiven orbit, there is no absorption or emission of energy. If the electron received extraenergy, it can jump into a higher energy level, this is also called excited state. Theelectron in the excited state can return to its original lower energy level or groundstate by releasing discreet amount of energy in the form of light​</h2><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>1. A. Hydrogen</strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>Hydrogen is the lightest gas and element and is the most abundant in the universe.</strong></p><p><strong>2. C. When Hydrogen nuclear fusion begins</strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>As the protostar gains mass, its core gets hotter and more dense. At some point, </strong><strong>it will be hot enough and dense enough for hydrogen to start fusing into helium.</strong></p><p><strong>3 .A. Stellar Nucleosynthesis  </strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which elements are created within stars </strong><strong>by combining the protons and neutrons together from the nuclei of </strong><strong>lighter elements.</strong></p><p><strong>4. D. Supernova Nucleosynthesis</strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>Supernovae (exploding massive stars at the ends of their lives) are the main sites of heavy-element</strong><strong> </strong><strong>production</strong><strong>, leading to chemical enrichment of galaxies and, ultimately, the universe. </strong></p><p><strong>5.  B. Cl2</strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>For example, </strong><strong>the Cl2 molecule has no polar bonds because the electron charge is identical on both atoms. It is therefore a nonpolar molecule.</strong></p><p><strong>6. B. CS2</strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>CS2 (Carbon disulfide) is nonpolar because of its symmetric (linear) shape.</strong><strong> Although carbon and sulfur differ in their electronegativity and C-S bond is polar, the polarity of both opposite C-S bonds gets canceled by each other resulting in a nonpolar molecule.</strong></p><p><strong>7. D. Nonpolar covalent</strong></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>Nonpolar molecules have an electronegativity difference of 0-0.5</strong><strong> while polar molecules have an electronegativity difference of 0.6-2.0.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I HOPE IT HELPS:)</strong></p><br />
