Based on a recent study, at most 93% of Filipinos consume a caffeinated drink at least once a week. You work as an independent market researcher and were asked to test this claim. To do this, ask at least 50 students in your school whether they consume a caffeinated drink at least once a week. You may use the following table: The company would like more specific details about the study. Using the results you obtained, conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether the percentage of students at your school who consume a caffeinated drink is more than 93% at 0.05 significance level. Do the following: 1. State the null and alternative hypotheses. 2. Determine the type of hypothesis test. 3. Determine the appropriate form of test statistic. 4. Determine the critical values. 5. Determine the rejection region. Illustrate using a normal curve. 6. Make a decision whether to reject the null hypothesis. 7. Answer the following questions: a. What conclusion can you draw from the study? b. Do you think that introducing a new brand of coffee would increase the percentage of caffeine drinkers? Why or why not? The company will use your report for further study and recommendation, so make sure it is neat, organized, and accurate.​</a>

Respondents receive online surveys via various mediums such as email, embedded over website, social media etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Organizations implement online surveys to use the internet in order to gain insights and feedback about upcoming products or services, change in marketing strategies, enhancement in current features etc. With the progress made by the internet, more and more organizations depend on the data received and analyzed from online surveys to make integral changes in their functioning. For efficient data collection, organizations must choose an advanced and efficient online survey platform.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Characteristics of Online Surveys</p><p></p><p>There are six distinct characteristics that should ideally define online surveys.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Purpose of the online survey: This is the most important characteristic of online surveys. An established survey can only lead to appalling results. Researchers should decide the objective of conducting an online survey so that the gauged results can be used to enhance products/service, customer service or any other pre-decided objective.</p><p></p><p>Accurate research design: For an online survey to bear efficient results, it is important for the researcher to design a thorough research design. How to carry out market research and analysis using online surveys – this can be decided by implementing research design. Research design will help market researchers in deciding how to collect information using online surveys and how to measure and analyze collected data.The type of research design can be decided according to the research problem an organization is facing. Upon detecting the research problem, a market researcher can decide from among various types of research design: Cross-sectional, longitudinal, experimental, correlational etc.In case, an organization intends to conduct an online survey at a particular time, the researchers can rely on cross-sectional research design and in situations where the organization wants to observe a change in pattern from a particular time interval to another, the researchers can rely on longitudinal research design.</p><p></p><p>Precisely structured survey questions: An efficient survey should include a carefully curated balance of open-ended and closed-ended survey questions. There are various question types which can suffice different purposes of online surveys. The questions added in an online survey should be effective in obtaining the required information from the selected sample.Some of the most widely used survey questions are:</p><p></p><p>Multiple-choice questions</p><p></p><p>Dichotomous questions</p><p></p><p>Matrix questions</p><p></p><p>Likert Scale questions</p><p></p><p>A researcher will be able to gather effective information from online surveys only when the purpose of the survey is justified with the type of survey questions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For example, Likert scale questions can be used to know the level of agreement of respondents with a particular statement, or Matrix questions can be used where there is a long list of similar questions and there is a likelihood of respondents dropping off a survey if these questions are not combined. Researchers should understand the purpose of an online survey to ensure that the survey questions are well-structured to garner crucial details.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Clearly defined target sample: A sample is a representative section of target respondents who represent the required characteristics for research and whose inputs can be generalized and applied to the entire target market.After filtering a sample from the target population, the number of individuals who are a part of the sample will be indicative of the sample size. A sample can be formed on the basis of various aspects such as demographics, profession or any other factor according to the researcher’s experience and knowledge.Samples can be formed using two sampling methods:</p><p></p><p>Probability Sampling: A theory of probability is used to form a sample using the Probability Sampling method. In this sampling method, every individual of a target population has an equal opportunity to be a part of a selected sample.</p><p></p><p>Non-probability Sampling: Non-probability sampling is a technique where the sample is chosen on the basis of the researcher’s judgment, experience and knowledge and not on random selection.</p><p></p><p>1.true</p><br />

The experimental treatment applied in this experiment is comparing the charge capacity of the graphene-made battery to that of a conventional battery.</p><p></p><p>5.) The control in this experiment would be the conventional battery, as it represents the existing technology against which the performance of the graphene-made battery is being compared.</p><p></p><p>6.) If I were the manufacturer, I would conduct a controlled experiment to test the performance of my invention. This would involve setting up a controlled environment in which I can test the charge capacity of the graphene-made battery under the same conditions as the conventional battery. I would also need to control for any extraneous variables, such as the temperature and age of the batteries, and use multiple samples of each type of battery to ensure the reliability of the results.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Try again</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it's help</p><br />
