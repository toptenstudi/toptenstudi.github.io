This is most easily evident in the conversation between Alfredo and his fiancée,Esperanza, about Calixta, their note-carrier who grew up in the latter's family. The scene depicts a parallelismin the circumstance of Alfredo and his new love, Julia, and Calixta and her live-in partner. However, while noone blatantly frowns upon the budding relationship between Alfredo and Julia, except for some whisperedrumors that reach Esperanza, Calixta is dubbed" ungrateful to her master for doing such an act. Alfredo doesnot have to answer to anyone for his unfaithfulness, but Calixta is responsible not only for what her familymight think, but also for the members of her master's family. Despite the same circumstances, the two peopleare regarded differently based on their positions in life.ACTIVITY 2After reading the passage above, answer the following questions in your answer sheet.1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

Black, Brown, White By Nemah N. Hermosa (Adapted from a Philippine folktale) Once upon a time, there were no people. There was only the Earth and the god Kabunian. He said, "The earth is a beautiful place. But who will take care of it? I will make people." In the afternoon, Kabunian got some clay. He worked for a long time. When he finished making a man, it was night. The color of the night became the color of the man. "He is too dark," Kabunian said. The next morning, Kabunian woke up before sunrise. He got some clay. He made a man. When the sun came up, Kabunian saw the man. "He is too white," Kabunian said. So Kabunian got more clay. He made another man. It was noon. The hot sun made the man brown. "I like this brown man," said Kabunian. Kabunian sent the men to different parts of the Earth. That is why there are black people and white people. That is why Filipinos are brown. Questions: 1. Who made the men? 2. When was the brown man made? 3. Where did Kabunian send the men? 4. What is the color of the man made at night?5. Why did Kabunian create the men?​</a>

Ullereaus textRead and study the sample short Marxist criticism of "Dead Stars" below, a classic Filipino short story by PazMarquez BenitezThe imbalanced societal power play is evident in the short story in the form of treatment of thecharacters based on their class. This is most easily evident in the conversation between Alfredo and his fiancée,Esperanza, about Calixta, their note-carrier who grew up in the latter's family. The scene depicts a parallelismin the circumstance of Alfredo and his new love, Julia, and Calixta and her live-in partner. However, while noone blatantly frowns upon the budding relationship between Alfredo and Julia, except for some whisperedrumors that reach Esperanza, Calixta is dubbed" ungrateful to her master for doing such an act.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

When he finished making a man, it was night. The color of the night became the color of the man. "He is too dark," Kabunian said. The next morning, Kabunian woke up before sunrise. He got some clay. He made a man. When the sun came up, Kabunian saw the man. "He is too white," Kabunian said. So Kabunian got more clay. He made another man. It was noon. The hot sun made the man brown. "I like this brown man," said Kabunian. Kabunian sent the men to different parts of the Earth. That is why there are black people and white people. That is why Filipinos are brown. Questions: 1.
