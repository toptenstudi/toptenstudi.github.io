                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sociologists are interested in the relationship between the institution of marriage and the institution of family because families are the most basic social unit upon which society is built, but also because marriage and family are linked to other social institutions such as the economy, government, and religion.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope its help good night</p><p>Family: </p><p></p>Family is the basic unit of society as it is the building block to what we call society. This social institution includes the economy, religion, education, politics, or governmental health care or medicine. The family unit has specific functions in relation to its members and to the total society.<p></p>The most important of this is it serves as a means of transferring culture from one stage to another. The sharing of works among the members of the family is a strong influence on keeping the family together. Sometimes we are applying the word clan to a family or group of families that are related to each other. Family, a basic social group united through bonds of kinship or marriage, present in all societies. Ideally, the family provides its members with protection, companionship, security, and socialization.<p></p>The structure of the family as such fulfills the needs of the individual members and of society. The nuclear family, two adults, and their children are the main unit in some societies. In others, it is a subordinate part of an extended family, which also consists of grandparents and other relatives. A third family unit is a single-parent family, in which children live with an unmarried, divorced, or widowed mother or father.<br />
