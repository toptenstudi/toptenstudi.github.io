                                            Capitalize the words that need capitalization in the selection. (20 points) there are three religious versions for naming the town "Rosario." these are: The first version says the image of the madonna and the child was found one day floating on the water by a group of kids playing along the seashore. They played with the image, using it as a toy and afterwards hid it in the bushes near the sea. Every time they came back, however, they would see the image already floating leisurely on the water, as if waiting for them. They thought it strange, but could not explain how the image got back to the water. Not long after their elders learned about the image and took it to an empty nipa shack. Thus began a public veneration of the madonna and Child. The hut was transformed into a place of worship. News of miraculous happenings attributed to the image spread around. The religious fervor was so great and the people were moved by the image that they decided to adopt it as the patroness of the town and changed the name Salinas marcella to rosario. The different names given to the town are remembered. Marcella exists as one of the national roads of the town. Salinas is associated with the finest and famous smoked fish (Tinapang salinas) produced by the townspeople. Rosario was formerly called tejero, which may have originated from the word tejer (Spanish to weave) because weaving fish nets was then the main occupation of the women. Rosario was also called Salinas derived from the word sal (Spanish salt) during the Philippine Revolution because salt-making was a prime industry of the town. The place was likewise called Marcella or Marcelles due to its proximity to the sea (“mar” in Spanish). Rosario was, finally, named in honor of their patroness nuestra señora Virgen del Santissimo Rosario, Reina de Caracol or (Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary)</a>

                            20. Capitalize the words that need capitalization in the selection. (20 points) there are three religious versions for naming the town "Rosario." these are: The first version says the image of the madonna and the child was found one day floating on the water by a group of kids playing along the seashore. They played with the image, using it as a toy and afterwards hid it in the bushes near the sea. Every time they came back, however, they would see the image already floating leisurely on the water, as if waiting for them. They thought it strange, but could not explain how the image got back to the water. Not long after their elders learned about the image and took it to an empty nipa shack. Thus began a public veneration of the madonna and Child. The hut was transformed into a place of worship. News of miraculous happenings attributed to the image spread around. The religious fervor was so great and the people were moved by the image that they decided to adopt it as the patroness of the town and changed the name Salinas marcella to rosario. The different names given to the town are remembered. Marcella exists as one of the national roads of the town. Salinas is associated with the finest and famous smoked fish (Tinapang salinas) produced by the townspeople. Rosario was formerly called tejero, which may have originated from the word tejer (Spanish to weave) because weaving fish nets was then the main occupation of the women. Rosario was also called Salinas derived from the word sal (Spanish salt) during the Philippine Revolution because salt-making was a prime industry of the town. The place was likewise called Marcella or Marcelles due to its proximity to the sea (“mar” in Spanish). Rosario was, finally, named in honor of their patroness nuestra señora Virgen del Santissimo Rosario, Reina de Caracol or (Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary)</h2><br />
