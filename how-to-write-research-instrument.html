It uses interviews, questionnaires, and sampling polls to get a sense of behaviorwith intense precision.A. It tests for the relationships between two variables. Performing correlationalresearch is done to establish what the effect of one on the other might be andhow that affects the relationship,5. It is conducted in order to explain a noticed occurrence. In correlational researchthe survey is conducted on a minimum of two groups.6. This research method involves the discretion, recognition, analysis andinterpretation of condition that currently exist.7. This research examines patterns of similarities and differences across a moderatenumber of cases,8. Though questions may be posed in the other forms of research, experimentalresearch is guided specifically by a hypothesis. Sometimes experimental researchcan have several hypotheses,9. it is a statement to be proven or disproved. Once that statement is madeexperiments are bregun to find out whether the statement is true or not.10. This research can be exciting and highly informative.11. It established cause and effect relationships.12. The extent to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure andperforms as it is designed to perform13.

                                            Activity 2. Research: Fact or Bluff Directions: Read the following statement carefully. Write TRUE if the statement is correct; FALSE if not. 1. Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</a>

When a frequency is played, other frequencies, called harmonics, are created. Each instrument has a unique harmonic character. The duration of the notes, or envelope, played on different instruments also varies widely.</p><p></p><p><strong>How thermos bottle minimizes heat transfer?</strong></p><p>-A vacuum flask, or thermos, does not allow heat transfer by any of the three ways that heat can travel. The silver coating on the inner bottle prevents heat transfer by radiation, and the vacuum between its double wall prevents heat moving by convection. The thinness of the glass walls stops heat entering or leaving the flask by conduction. The case surrounding the flask provides additional insulation.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>--taeberryvv</p><br />

There is a predictor variable or group of subjects that cannot be manipulated bythe experimenter.2. The research focuses on verifiable observation as opposed to theory or logic,3. It uses interviews, questionnaires, and sampling polls to get a sense of behaviorwith intense precision.A. It tests for the relationships between two variables. Performing correlationalresearch is done to establish what the effect of one on the other might be andhow that affects the relationship,5. It is conducted in order to explain a noticed occurrence. In correlational researchthe survey is conducted on a minimum of two groups.6. This research method involves the discretion, recognition, analysis andinterpretation of condition that currently exist.7. This research examines patterns of similarities and differences across a moderatenumber of cases,8. Though questions may be posed in the other forms of research, experimentalresearch is guided specifically by a hypothesis. Sometimes experimental researchcan have several hypotheses,9. it is a statement to be proven or disproved. Once that statement is madeexperiments are bregun to find out whether the statement is true or not.10. This research can be exciting and highly informative.11. It established cause and effect relationships.12. The extent to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure andperforms as it is designed to perform13.

Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</h2><br />

Who is affected when a researcher does not observe ethics? How are they
affected?
Is a research still valid even when the instrument was implemented
unethically? Why?
How can one tell that a research is unethical? Give at least three signs.
Support your arguments with valid and reliable sources and examples.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Everyone </strong>is impacted by a researcher's failure to uphold ethics because it <strong>compromises both the scientific enterprise</strong> as a whole and the public's perception of science.</p><p>     Everyone is affected, in general, because it jeopardizes both the public's perception of science and the scientific endeavor as a whole. In order to ascertain who is affected and how, it would also be important to detail the circumstances of the ethical infraction under investigation. Study ethics sets the moral standards for scientists who conduct research. Adherence to ethical standards is necessary to respect study participants' rights, dignity, and well-being. An ethics committee should review each study involving human subjects to ensure that the appropriate ethical standards are being followed. Discussion of the ethical principles of beneficence, fairness, and autonomy is the main goal of ethical review. The study would no longer be legitimate. Because how we/you conduct a research demonstrates how much emphasis we/you place on the value of ethics, we/you must conduct it with respect and thoughtfulness. According to the USPHS Policy, research misconduct is "falsification, plagiarism, or fabrication in the proposing, doing, or reviewing of research, or in the reporting of research results." <strong>Falsification </strong>is the manipulation of research materials, equipment, or processes, or the changing or omitting of data or results so that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. <strong>Fabrication </strong>is the creation of data or results and recording or reporting them. <strong>Plagiarism </strong>is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. Honest mistakes or sincere differences of opinion are not considered research misconduct. Tampering involves the unauthorized removal or modification of College records (such as library books, reference materials, official institutional forms, and correspondence), software, equipment, or other academic-related items, including other students' work. It should be emphasized that tampering as a type of cheating may also be viewed as illegal behavior and be the subject of legal action. ripping out the pages of a journal article from the library; altering a student's academic record, a letter of recommendation, or another official college record; purposefully undermining another student's work; electronically altering the files, data, assignments, or reports of a fellow student or colleague. The unauthorized duplication of copyrighted materials, including software and other non-print media, is against academic integrity. Individuals are permitted to copy articles or brief passages of books for their own use under the legal idea of "fair use," as well as to use an image to illustrate a point. Copyright infringement include, for example: Making or distributing copies of a copyrighted material for a group (on paper or electronically); Sharing a video or image of an artist's creation without authorization (such a Netter® or Adam® anatomical sketch); Copies of lengthy books. <strong>Research ethics</strong> are important for a number of reasons. They promote the aims of research, such as expanding knowledge. They support the values required for collaborative work, such as mutual respect and fairness. This is essential because scientific research depends on collaboration between researchers and groups</p><p>Misconduct in Research and Other Unethical Behavior</p>Reporting erroneous details in order to obtain an advantage;Missing information or data that causes findings or conclusions to be misrepresented or distorted;Giving bogus justifications for being absent or excused from a task, a lesson, or a clerkship;<p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>Research</strong>: https://brainly.in/question/24094718</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
