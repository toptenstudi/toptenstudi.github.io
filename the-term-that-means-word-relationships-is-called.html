                                            So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

                                            What is It An analogy is a literary device that compares the relationship between things that have differences and similarities. It is a way to clarify an idea by comparing it to something familiar. It is like simile and metaphor We use analogies all the time, informally. In written, or in conversation when you compare one situation to another, you are using analogy. Example of analogy cats: clutter: wolves: pack You can read this as: Cats is to clutter as wolves is to pack, In this example, clutter refers to a group of cats. Similarly, pack is the specific term for a group of wolves. Both pairs of words in the analogy illustrate the same relationship. The relationship between the words in the first pair is compared to the relationship of words in the second pair. This is what we call an analogy.

Undefined Terms- are terms that don't require a formal definition.- defined precisely 2.Defined Terms- are terms defined from the undefined terms in the system.3.Postulate-is a statement that is accepted as true without any proof.4.Theorem- is a statement that has to be proved before being accepted. pls can you help me this??​</h2><br />

                            22. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />

                            24. What is It An analogy is a literary device that compares the relationship between things that have differences and similarities. It is a way to clarify an idea by comparing it to something familiar. It is like simile and metaphor We use analogies all the time, informally. In written, or in conversation when you compare one situation to another, you are using analogy. Example of analogy cats: clutter: wolves: pack You can read this as: Cats is to clutter as wolves is to pack, In this example, clutter refers to a group of cats. Similarly, pack is the specific term for a group of wolves. Both pairs of words in the analogy illustrate the same relationship. The relationship between the words in the first pair is compared to the relationship of words in the second pair. This is what we call an analogy.
