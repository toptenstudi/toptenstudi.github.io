                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>summary</p><p></p><p>Hades, the son of Cronos, was the brother of Zeus (king of the gods in Greek myth) and Poseidon (god of the sea). Hades rules over the underworld, or Hell. This came about because the three brothers divided up the world between them: Zeus took the heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Hades, the underworld.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hades ruled over the dead, with the help of a whole crew of demons who worked for him. When Orpheus descended into the underworld to beg Hades for his wife, Eurydice, he charmed Hades’ demon minions with his beautiful song. (We discuss the Orpheus and Eurydice myth in a separate post.)</p><p></p><p>Persephone, meanwhile, was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter (or, in some versions, the daughter of Zeus and Styx, the female embodiment of the river in the underworld). She was Hades’ niece; this didn’t stop him from falling in love with her and abducting her from the land of the living, taking her down into the underworld.</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to tradition, Persephone was picking flowers on the plain around Mount Etna, on Sicily, when Hades appeared from out of the ground, and she was carried off by her uncle. (Other versions have Persephone’s abduction taking place on Crete, or along the River Cephussis at Eleusis.) She is said to have been pulling a narcissus flower out of the earth when Hades appeared from the small hole underneath where the flower had been.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Zeus aided his brother Hades in this abduction. Demeter, Persephone’s mother, heard her daughter’s screams as she was carried off by Hades, but she was unable to find her. Demeter effectively went on strike, abstaining from her role as earth goddess and disguising herself as an old woman at the court of King Celeus at Eleusis. As a result, the earth became sterile and no crops would grow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When he saw what Persephone’s abduction had caused, Zeus decided that Hades should return Persephone. However, it was too late by this point, as Persephone had eaten the pomegranate seed, and this meant that she had to remain in the underworld.</p><p></p><p>To eat the fruit of one’s captor, in Greek custom, was to agree to remain with them; until this point, Persephone had been fasting, but when she gave in and ate the pomegranate seeds, her fate was sealed. (Ascalaphus was in the garden of Hades when she ate the seed, and saw her do it; because this meant she had broken her fast, she was condemned to remain with Hades, especially after Ascalaphus went and grassed her up.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>But Demeter was adamant: she wanted her daughter back with her. Zeus hit upon a compromise: Persephone would spend half the year with Hades in the underworld, and half the year in the land of the living, with Demeter. Specifically, Persephone would spend the winter with Hades and the summer with Demeter. This would be repeated every year, thus explaining the origins of the seasons of the year.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps ty.</p><br />

                            12. Sexual Reproduction In HumansHumans (and all animals that reproduce sexually) have cells called gametes, Gametes are formed during meloals and come in the form of sperm (produced by males) or eggs (produced by females). When conditions are right, sperm and egg unite in a procese known as fertilization. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, contains genes from both parents.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Sexual reproduction requires two parents. Each parent contributes a gamete - a sex cell that has half of the normal DNA of a regular body cell. In males, the gametes are sperm and in females, the gametes are eggs.</p><p></p><p>2. In asexual reproduction all the genes in the offspring come from one parent. In sexual reproduction one full set of the genes come from each parent. Living things produce offspring of the same species, but in many cases offspring are not identical with each other or with their parents.</p><p></p><p>3. Asexual reproduction does not involve sex cells or fertilisation . Only one parent is required, unlike sexual reproduction which needs two parents. ...

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Sexual reproduction requires two parents. Each parent contributes a gamete - a sex cell that has half of the normal DNA of a regular body cell. In males, the gametes are sperm and in females, the gametes are eggs.</p><p></p><p>2. In asexual reproduction all the genes in the offspring come from one parent. In sexual reproduction one full set of the genes come from each parent. Living things produce offspring of the same species, but in many cases offspring are not identical with each other or with their parents.</p><p></p><p>3. Asexual reproduction does not involve sex cells or fertilisation. Only one parent is required, unlike sexual reproduction which needs two parents. ... As a result, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent and to each other.
