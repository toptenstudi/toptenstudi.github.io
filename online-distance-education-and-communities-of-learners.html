                                            Assess the credibility of the article below using the checklist. DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

                                            Let's EVALUATE 1. Distance learning is any learning that happens without the learne being physically present to do or study the lesson. Learners m communicate with their teachers through mail or electronic mail. This a big help in education because learners can continue their education especially in this time of pandemic. The learning will never stop because of the distance learning.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc. Venn Diagramd. Cause and Effect Charte. Problem Solution2. Have you ever seen a mouse or rat in or around your home? If so, you may have a rodent infestation. Mice and rats are considered pests since they steal food from people. They are hard to get rid of because they move quickly, and they hide in walls and other tight places that are difficult for people to reach.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc. Venn Diagramd. Cause and Effect Charte. Problem Solution3. There are two types of people in this world: cat people and dog people. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs because cats are very independent. Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefer a pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets.a. Bubble Map b.

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bactería. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc.

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bacteria. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack. A. Bubble MapB. Events ChainC.

                                            EDITORIAL Face-to-face classes(The Philippine Star) - December 1, 2020 - 12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended learning. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning.Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task.Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resuming limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period.The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the "Community Learning Hubs" set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadgets or WiFi at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult learners can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers.Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom learning has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to face classes.President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and inclusive learning.16. What is the editorial text all about?A. Distance LearningB.

In terms of teaching the same concepts in new ways, technology provides a variety of chances to make learning more entertaining and pleasurable. For example, employing gamification to give instruction, bringing students on virtual field trips, and utilizing other online learning resources. Furthermore, technology can promote greater active participation in the learning process, which is difficult to achieve in a traditional lecture setting. For educational purposes, students in this age join communities and online groups. For most students, technology is a major component in their ability to learn through the internet with individuals from all over the world.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. Assess the credibility of the article below using the checklist. DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

Have you ever seen a mouse or rat in or around your home? If so, you may have a rodent infestation. Mice and rats are considered pests since they steal food from people.

Cause and Effect Charte. Problem Solution3. There are two types of people in this world: cat people and dog people. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs because cats are very independent. Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefer a pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets.a. Bubble Map b.

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bactería. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc.

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bacteria. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack. A. Bubble MapB. Events ChainC.

                            25. EDITORIAL Face-to-face classes(The Philippine Star) - December 1, 2020 - 12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended learning. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning.Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task.Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resuming limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period.The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the "Community Learning Hubs" set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadgets or WiFi at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult learners can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers.Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom learning has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to face classes.President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and inclusive learning.16. What is the editorial text all about?A. Distance LearningB. Face to Face classesC. Online LearningD. DepEd order17. Which is the source of this editorial text?A. SchoolsB. The Philippine StarC. Learning hubD. Office of the Vice President18.

It is a place where children without gadget or wifi can access the internet for their online classes, and the difficult learners can also have tutor.20. Do you agree with the decision of President Rodrigo Duterte wherein he says, "there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available," why or why not?​</h2><br />
