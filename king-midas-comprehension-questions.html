                                            Read the story below. Answer the questions below. The Midas Touch There was once a king named Midas who loved gold. One day, God appeared before him and asked him to wish for anything. Being greedy about gold, Midas said, "Everything I touch should turn to gold." God granted his wish and told him that, from the next day, everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas was very happy. He woke up early the next morning and went around touching everything and turning them to gold. Aft a while, Midas felt hungry. He picked up a piece of bread to eat, but it turned to gold. When he picked up a glass of water to quench his thirst, it turned to gold as well. As Midas was thinking about what to do, his daughter rushed to him. And, when Midas touched her, she turned into a golden statue. Miserable and teary-eyed, Midas no longer wanted the boon. He prayed to God and atoned for his greed. Pleased by Midas' prayer, God asked him to wash his hands in the nearby river to get rid of the golden touch. Midas returned after washing his hands and found that everything he had changed to gold had turned back to normal. Moral of the story: Greed can be destructive. Also, there are many things in life more important and precious than gold or riches. Copy and answer the questions below in your paper. 1. Who are the characters of the story? 2. What did King Midas pray to God? 3. Describe the characteristics of King Midas. 4. Do you think King Midas is a good king? Why? 5. How the story end?​</a>

MIDA’S TOUCH
by Charlotte Craft
In ancient Greek, there was a king named Midas. He had a lot of gold and everything he needed.
He also had a beautiful daughter. Midas loved his gold very much, but he loved his daughter more than
his riches.
One day, a satyr named Silenus got drunk and passed out in Midas’ rose garden. Believing that
Satyrs always bring good luck, Midas lets Silenus rest in his palace until he is sober, against the wishes
of his wife and daughter. Silenus is a friend of Dionysus, the god of wine and celebration. Upon learning
Midas’ kindness towards his friend, Dionysus decides to reward the keg.
When asked to wish for something, Midas says “I wish everything I touch turns to gold”. Although
Dionysus knew it was not a great idea, he granted Midas his wish.
Happy that his wish was granted, Midas went around touching random things in the garden and
his palace and turned them all into gold. He touched an apple, and it turned into a shiny gold apple. His
subjects were astonished but happy to see so much gold in the palace.
In his happiness, Midas went and hugged his daughter, and before he realized it, he turned her
into a lifeless, golden statue! Aghast, Midas ran back to the garden and called for Dionysus. He begged
the god to take away his power and save his daughter. Dionysus gives Midas a solution to change
everything back to how it was before the wish. Midas learned his lesson and lived the rest of his life
contended with what he had.

If I could have one wish,” said the King, “I would ask that everything I touch should turn to shimmering gold.” The next day, Midas woke early and as soon as he saw the rising sun, he reached out and lightly touched his bed. Instantly, it turned to gold</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.) I don't know the Answer, SORRY</p><p></p><p></p><p>3.)The king was not satisfied with the answers because everyone were giving different answer to the same question and he was angry because he couldn't make a conclusion, so he didn't gave reward to anyone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4.)But then a bright idea occurred to him, and he said to the shining stranger, “I wish that everything that I touch may turn to gold.” The stranger smiled and said, “A golden touch! Are you quite sure you would be satisfied then?” “Yes, I would be perfectly happy and ask for nothing more,” answered King Midas. </p><p></p><p></p><p>5.)Even though he was very rich, Midas thought that his greatest happiness was provided by gold.

When he gazed at the gold-colored clouds of a beautiful sunset, he would wish that the clouds were real gold. If King Midas loved anything as much or more than he loved gold, it was his little daughter, who was named Marygold. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>King Midas and his touch</p><p>The story of King Midas is a myth about the tragedy of avarice and narrates what happens when true happiness is not recognized. Midas was a man who wished that everything he touched would turn into gold. However, he had not thought that this wish was not actually a blessing, but a curse. His greed invites us to think and realize the consequences that may lead us to become slaves of our own desires. The phrase the Midas touch comes from this myth and is used to say that somebody has a good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Discover the myth of King Midas and his golden touch</p><p>The wish</p><p>Midas was a king of great fortune who ruled the country of Phrygia, in Asia Minor. He had everything a king could wish for. He lived in luxury in a great castle. He shared his life of abundance with his beautiful daughter. Even though he was very rich, Midas thought that his greatest happiness was provided by gold. His avarice was such that he used to spend his days counting his golden coins! Occasionally he used to cover his body with gold objects, as if he wanted to bath in them. Money was his obsession.</p><p></p><p>One day, Dionyssus, the god of wine and revelry, passed through the kingdom of Midas. One of his companions, a satyr named Silenus, got delayed along the way. Silenus got tired and decided to take a nap in the famous rose gardens surrounding the palace of king Midas. There, he was found by the king, who recognized him instantly and invited him to spend a few days at his palace. After that, Midas took him to Dionyssus. The god of celebration, very grateful to Midas for his kindness, promised Midas to satisfy any wish of him. Midas though for a while and then he said: I hope that everything I touch becomes gold. Dionyssus warned the king to think well about his wish, but Midas was positive. Dionyssus could do nothing else and promised the king that from that following day everything he touched would turn into gold.</p><p></p><p>The curse</p><p>The next day, Midas, woke up eager to see if his wish would become true. He extended his arm touching a small table that immediately turned into gold. Midas jumped with happiness! He then touched a chair, the carpet, the door, his bathtub, a table and so he kept on running in his madness all over his palace until he got exhausted and happy at the same time! He sat at the table to have breakfast and took a rose between his hands to smell its fragrance. When he touched it, the rose became gold. I will have to absorb the fragrance without touching the roses, I suppose, he thought in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Without even thinking, he ate a grape but it also turned into gold! The same happened with a slice of bread and a glass of water. Suddenly, he started to sense fear. Tears filled his eyes and that moment, his beloved daughter entered the room. When Midas hugged her, she turned into a golden statue! Despaired and fearful, he raised his arms and prayed to Dionyssus to take this curse from him.</p><p></p><p>The atonement</p><p>The god heard Midas and felt sorry for him. He told Midas to go to river Pactolus and wash his hands. Midas did so: he ran to the river and was astonished to see gold flowing from his hands. The ancient Greeks said they had found gold on the banks of the river Pactolus. When he turned home, everything Midas had touched had become normal again.</p><p></p><p>Midas hugged his daughter in full happiness and decided to share his great fortune with his people. From now on, Midas became a better person, generous and grateful for all goods of his life. His people led a prosperous life and when he died</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS TO YOU:) </p><p></p><p></p><br />

MIDA’S TOUCH
by Charlotte Craft
In ancient Greek, there was a king named Midas. He had a lot of gold and everything he needed.
He also had a beautiful daughter. Midas loved his gold very much, but he loved his daughter more than
his riches.
One day, a satyr named Silenus got drunk and passed out in Midas’ rose garden. Believing that
Satyrs always bring good luck, Midas lets Silenus rest in his palace until he is sober, against the wishes
of his wife and daughter. Silenus is a friend of Dionysus, the god of wine and celebration. Upon learning
Midas’ kindness towards his friend, Dionysus decides to reward the keg.
When asked to wish for something, Midas says “I wish everything I touch turns to gold”. Although
Dionysus knew it was not a great idea, he granted Midas his wish.
Happy that his wish was granted, Midas went around touching random things in the garden and
his palace and turned them all into gold. He touched an apple, and it turned into a shiny gold apple. His
subjects were astonished but happy to see so much gold in the palace.
In his happiness, Midas went and hugged his daughter, and before he realized it, he turned her
into a lifeless, golden statue! Aghast, Midas ran back to the garden and called for Dionysus. He begged
the god to take away his power and save his daughter. Dionysus gives Midas a solution to change
everything back to how it was before the wish. Midas learned his lesson and lived the rest of his life
contended with what he had.

As you are thining, remember the story of King Midas (a king whose wish is that everything he would touch will turn into gold.) Use the following guide questions in creating your essay.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Magnetism is basically a non-contact force. It is the core of attraction and repulsion without having to touch the object they are attraction/repulsion. In this essay I will be explaining the uses of magnetism, positive and negative impacts it has on our everyday life, electromagnetism...etc.</p><p></p><p>Basically, magnets are pieces of metal containing cobalt, nickel or iron, that can attract other metals. Steel is a mixture which also contains iron, so it is a magnetic material as well, as iron oxide is a compound that can be made into a magnet by stroking it in the same direction. Not all metals are magnetic materials. It is possible to find natural magnets out of rocks or minerals but most magnets nowadays are manmade or manufactured.</p><p></p><p>Magnetism is extremely useful, and we can normally find them in our everyday life. For example, many of us use magnets to stick things on the fridge, for compasses...etc. Doctors and surgeons also take magnetism to their advantage. They use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to visualize internal structures which helps them to spot problems in a patient’s body without invasive surgery. An MRI machine uses a magnetic field to align the magnetization of atoms in the body. MRI scans are now used frequently nowadays by doctors to help diagnose cancer, brain tumors...etc. It is the safest and best way to see inside the human body without performing surgery.</p><p>Another use for magnetism is for reading information on credit cards.</p><p></p><p>The Earth is like a huge magnet, it’s liquid core contains iron, and as it moves, it creates an electric current that causes a magnetic field to surround the Earth. The North Pole and the North Magnetic Pole are not the same thing, as the north magnetic pole is constantly moving, whereas the north pole stays in the same place. Therefore, if you rely on a compass to point you to the north pole, it will probably direct you to the north magnetic pole instead.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps </p><br />
