                                            Learning Inputs: 1. We use the past tense of the verb when we talk about a thing that happened and ended in the past. It shows that a completed action took place at a specific time in the past. 2. Simple past tense are actions that happened in a specific point in time like yesterday, last month, last year, an hour ago or when you were a kid. Specific point in time connotes that you know when the action happened. These are also used for repeated actions that something happened repeatedly in the past. 3. Remember that for regular verbs, we add +d (with verbs ending with the letter 'e') and we add +ed on the base form if the verb to change it in to the past form; but not for irregular verbs. Irregular verbs do not have a simple rule for understanding past tense conjugation. You simply have to practice remembering these irregular verbs and how to change them into different forms. 4. We use the past perfect tense (sometimes called 'past of the past to describe an earlier action that took place in the past before another past action. It is used to make clear that the event or state happened before another in the past. It does not matter what event is mentioned first, the tense makes it clear which one happened first. 5. There are different forms in writing and using the past perfect. We can use it to state affirmative statements, negative statements and even ask questions.​</a>

A mountain system or mountain belt is a group of mountain ranges with similarity in form, structure, and alignment that have arisen from the same cause, usually an orogeny.[1] Mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes, but most of the significant ones on Earth are the result of plate tectonics.

                            12. Learning Inputs: 1. We use the past tense of the verb when we talk about a thing that happened and ended in the past. It shows that a completed action took place at a specific time in the past. 2. Simple past tense are actions that happened in a specific point in time like yesterday, last month, last year, an hour ago or when you were a kid. Specific point in time connotes that you know when the action happened. These are also used for repeated actions that something happened repeatedly in the past. 3. Remember that for regular verbs, we add +d (with verbs ending with the letter 'e') and we add +ed on the base form if the verb to change it in to the past form; but not for irregular verbs. Irregular verbs do not have a simple rule for understanding past tense conjugation. You simply have to practice remembering these irregular verbs and how to change them into different forms. 4. We use the past perfect tense (sometimes called 'past of the past to describe an earlier action that took place in the past before another past action. It is used to make clear that the event or state happened before another in the past. It does not matter what event is mentioned first, the tense makes it clear which one happened first. 5. There are different forms in writing and using the past perfect. We can use it to state affirmative statements, negative statements and even ask questions.​</h2><br />
