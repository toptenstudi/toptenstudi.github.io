                                            Contemporary WorldSTAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS1. The Diplomatic History Stage. It was stretched up to the end of the First World War and was dominated by the historians and the attention was focused on 
the study of the history of political and diplomatic relations among nations.2. The Current Events Stage. This stage was concerned with the present without attempting to trace the historical roots of the problems and events. The review of newspapers, periodicals and journals was considered to be the right and necessary 
 step for understanding the day-to-day relations among nations.3. The Law and Organization Stage. The third stage involved an attempt to reform the nature and content of international relations in future through the 
development and improvement of international law and institutions. This stage was
 influenced by a strong faith in the goodness of human relations.4. The Contemporary Stage. The focus on international relations becomes more systematic. The 21st century has come with the need to end international terrorism, 
with a systematic and bold move for the protection of human rights, 
protections of the environment, and with attempts at securing sustainable development 
through increasing cooperation in the international relations sphere.Guided Question: Based on what you have learned, critique briefly the stages of development 
of international relations relative to their strengths and weaknesses respectively.Note: Write the strength and weaknesses of each stages.Stage 1Strength: Weakness: Stage 2Strength: Weakness: Stage 3Strength: Weakness: Stage 4Strength: Weakness: ​</a>

Solve a certain problem that the community needs.</p><p> </p><p>3.In the short run, a lack of resources may actually improve performance, as the business stretches to do more for less. Lean and hungry may lead to better performance. When employees realize that their livelihoods and futures depend upon their performance, extra effort may be the result.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the lack of resources may cause an increasing drag on business performance. A certain weariness and fatigue from the constant stress of cash-strapped businesses operating on marginal resources will weaken the performance of even the most dedicated staff.</p><p></p><p>When the lack of resources becomes acute, the business is in serious risk of failure. Most often this happens when there aren’t enough cash resources, but it can also occur when the human resources ( staff ) aren’t adequate, or there’s not enough inventory. Many otherwise successful businesses have tanked as the result of not enough human resources, or cash flow problems.</p><p></p><p>The analysis of business performance and resource allocation is an important part of management.
