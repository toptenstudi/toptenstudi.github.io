By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.

                                            Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</a>

As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

                            9. Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</h2><br />

The Circle by Dave Eggers: "When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world’s most powerful internet company, she feels she’s been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge."

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.
