                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Surrealistic art is characterized by dream-like visuals, the use of symbolism, and collage images. Several prominent artists came from this movement, including Magritte, Dali, and Ernst.</strong></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>This vocabulary is made up of six basic elements: Line, Texture, Shape, Form, Color, and Value. Whether you do abstract art, non-objective, or even realistic, you'll find at least one, if not more, of these elements at work.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>But unlike Op Art, which was used on a variety of materials, Pop Art designs were frequently applied to paper dresses in keeping with the idea of disposability and consumerism advocated by Pop Art. The Op art movement was driven by artists who were interested in investigating various perceptual effects.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Traditional art aimed to represent reality or realism through narrative. Whereas, modern art aimed to throw aside the tradition of the past and experiment with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The principles of art represent how the artist uses the elements of art to create an effect and to help convey the artist's intent. The principles of art and design are balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and unity/variety.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Characteristic features of later 20th-century music with origins in futurism include the prepared piano, integral serialism, extended vocal techniques, graphic notation, improvisation, and minimalism.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique concrète, electronic music, and concept music were all developed during this century. Jazz and ethnic folk music became important influences on many composers during this century.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Composition gives layout and structure to each art piece, and also affects the way the subject is perceived and understood. It leads the eye of the observer through the image and emphasizes the focal point.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO PLEASE</p><br />
