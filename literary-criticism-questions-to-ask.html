                    <p>Typical Questions to be Asked when Reading as Reader-Response Critic • How does the interaction of text and reader create meaning? • What does a phrase-by-phrase analysis of a short literary text, or a key portion of a longer text, tell us about the reading experience pre- structured by (built into) that text? Do the sounds/shapes of the words as they appear on the page or how they are spoken by the reader enhance or change the meaning of the word/work? • How might we interpret a literary text to show that the reader&#039;s response is, or is analogous to, the topic of the story? What does the body of criticism published about a literary text suggest about the critics who interpreted that text and/or about the reading experience produced by that text? (Tyson 191)​</p>

Everybody was hungry and thirsty. Luckily Boule de Suif has brought food and wine enough for everyone however all of them reluctantly asked for they had condemned and insulted her. Finally, Monsieur Loiseau swallowed his pride and asked for food and wine and Boule de Suif delightedly served them all.At last, they stopped at Totes but Prussian officers interrogated and held them. They will be released if Boule de Suif will sleep with their commandant. She refused and everyone supported her. Five days had passed and they grew impatient and demanded Boule de Suif to sleep with the commandant and she was finally convinced.The following morning, nine passengers rose early to pack for travel while Boule de Suif has been left with no time to pack even her food to eat. She had to hurry to get into the coach. In the coach, they scomed her and called her shameful. No one thanked her for the food she shared when they were hungry and most of all no one thanked her for the sacrifice she did last night for them just to be released and be able to continue the travel. Boul de Suif silently burst in tears, sobbed in the night as the coach headed to Le Havre.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In the story "Boule de Suif," the social classes are highly emphasized. The characters were divided into two social classes, the wealthy and the less affluent. Boule de Suif represented the less privileged groups in society, while other passengers represented wealthy individuals.</p><p></p><p>2. The three main conflicts in the story are: (1) the conflict between the passengers' desire to consume Boule de Suif's food and wine and their disdain for her because of her social class; (2) the conflict between the passengers' desire to maintain their dignity and refusal to sacrifice for their country's honor and justice; and (3) the conflict between Boule de Suif's refusal to sleep with the Prussian commandant and the passengers' condemnation of her.</p><p></p><p>3. The effects of the conflict influenced Boule de Suif's character as it led her to a realization that her nobility and sacrifice were not appreciated by the passengers despite everything that she had done for them. Her character transformed from a brave and happy person to a sad and silent one, which shows the impact of social stigma towards her and her social class.</p><p></p><p>4. The underlying social issue highlighted in the story is class division, which differentiates people's opportunities, economic status, and cultural norms based on social classes.</p><p></p><p>5. The author's message on the issue of class division is that it promotes social inequality and injustice, regardless of the person's abilities, values, and contributions to society. The story emphasizes that society should address the issue of social stratification and value every individual equally, regardless of their social classes, background, or gender.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Recommended:</p><p></p><p>•Brainliest</p><p></p><p>•Heart/like</p><p></p><p>•Comment if whats wrong of my answer</p><p></p><p>•Rate 5 out of 5</p><p></p><p>•Follow</p><br />
