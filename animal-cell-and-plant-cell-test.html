                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A</p><p>The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide.</p><p>2.C.</p><p> Cancer cells</p><p>No, we don't all have cancer cells in our bodies. Our bodies are constantly producing new cells, some of which have the potential to become cancerous. At any given moment, we may be producing cells that have damaged DNA, but that doesn't mean they're destined to become cancer</p><p>3.B.</p><p>Kidneys-are two bean-shaped organs in excretory system.</p><p>4.B.</p><p>This means that in a flower, it can have both the female and male reproductive organ in it. It can also have a separate flower that has only the female or the male reproductive organ. Whereas animals mostly have only one reproductive organ in an organism in which it is either the female or male reproductive organ.</p><p>5. A.</p><p>Because the shoot system consists the leaves,flowers,twigs,stem and others that allow or make the plant to grow. And without the root system,the plant couldn't survive,because nothing will absorb water from the ground and distribute it to many parts of the plant.</p><p>6.A.</p><p>A group of cells working together is defined as a tissue and several tissues working together comprise an organ.
