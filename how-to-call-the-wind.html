Mallari There is a story in the Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of himself. But finally, its root gave way, and it tumbled down The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bends its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace 1. What does 'pliant" mean? 2. How does the bamboo show its pliancy? 3. Can a person be pliant too? How? 4 What are the Filipino characteristics displayed in the story? 5. If you will become one of the trees in the story, who will you choose to be? Why?​</a>

They circled and flew along. The moon saw the little leaves dancing. Each looked like a small brown bird The man in the moon smiled and listened And this is the song he heard. The North Wind is calling, is calling, And we must whirl round and round, And then, when our dancing is ended, We'll make a warm quilt for the ground. Answer the following questions 1. How were the leaves described in the poem? 2. Who saw the leaves dancing? 3. If you were the moon, what would you do? 4. What feeling did the moon show? 5. Why do you think he was happy? 6.

This is the way on how the body reacts automatically to the stimulus, which we call the reflex action. This is processed by the Nervous System parts.

                                            Activity 4-Simple Recall Direction: Recall one super typhoon that hits a certain region in the country, and explain how are the landmasses or the bodies of water of that certain area contribute to the formation of that super typhoon and the devastation it caused.SUMMARY     A typhoon develops when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. These winds gather moisture and rise, while colder air moves in below. This creates pressure, which causes the winds to maneuver very quickly. The winds rotate, or spin, around a center called a watch fixed. The warmer air and moisture there's, the more intense the winds. Landforms and bodies of water on and round the Philippines affect the strength or weakness of weather phenomenon like typhoons. Remarkably, landforms reduce the strength of typhoons whenever the winds impact them. Additionally, oceans, wherein the typhoons originate, provide advanced rainfall and strength. Large bodies of water, like oceans, seas and large lakes, can affect the climate of a section. Water heats and cools more gradually than landmasses. Therefore, the coastal regions will stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter, thus producing a more moderate climate with a narrower temperature range​</a>

Wind Vane<p></p>Extra information:<p></p><p>You know?The elements of weather are this temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and the last is cloud cover.</p><p></p>What is Temperature?<p><strong>Temperature</strong> as discussed in the past lesson. is measured with a thermometer and it refers to how hot or cold the atmosphere is. The unit of measure use is degree Celsius (°C) or degree Fahrenheit (°F).</p><p></p>What is Precipitation?<p><strong>Precipitation</strong> is any form of liquid or solid water particles that fall from the atmosphere and reach the surface of the Earth. These particles include drízzle, rain, hail, and on rare occasions. snow and sleet. Precipitation is caused when a mass of warm, moist air hits a mass of cold air. Condensation causes the moisture to form droplets that become rain or crystals that become snow or ice. When these droplets or crystals become too heavy to be suspended in the atmosphere, they fall to Earth as precipitation.</p><p></p>What is Wind Speed?<p>In meteorology, <strong>wind speed</strong>, or air flow velocity, is a major volume of the atmosphere caused by the movement of air from high to low pressure, usually due to changes in the form of temperature whether it is high or low.</p><p></p>What is Humidity?<p><strong>Humidity</strong> is the amount of water vapor in the air. If there is a lot of water vapor in the air, the humidity will be high. The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside. Too much or too little humidity can be dangerous. For example, high humidity combined with hot temperature is a combination that can be a health risk, especially for the very young and the very old.</p><p></p>What is Cloud Cover?<p><strong>Cloud cover</strong> refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds when observed from a particular location. Okta is usual unit of measurement of the cloud cover. Clouds can affect the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. Days are cooler than clear ones because clouds prevent more of the sun's radiation from reaching the Earth's surface. The opposite is true at night then, clouds act as a blanket, keeping the Earth warm.</p><p></p><p></p>Hi user's!<p>Kung tayo po ay mag aask ng isang tanong dito sa brainly, kung pede po sana ay ilagay natin ito sa tamang subject.</p><p></p><p>Pasensya na kung hindi na bababa sa 10 kada araw ang natutulungan ko dito sa brainly sa kadahilanan na medjo busy.</p><p></p><p>❤</p><br />

Mallari There is a story in the Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of himself. But finally, its root gave way, and it tumbled down The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bends its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace 1. What does 'pliant" mean? 2. How does the bamboo show its pliancy? 3. Can a person be pliant too? How? 4 What are the Filipino characteristics displayed in the story? 5. If you will become one of the trees in the story, who will you choose to be? Why?​</h2><br />

                            28. Activity 4-Simple Recall Direction: Recall one super typhoon that hits a certain region in the country, and explain how are the landmasses or the bodies of water of that certain area contribute to the formation of that super typhoon and the devastation it caused.SUMMARY     A typhoon develops when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. These winds gather moisture and rise, while colder air moves in below. This creates pressure, which causes the winds to maneuver very quickly. The winds rotate, or spin, around a center called a watch fixed. The warmer air and moisture there's, the more intense the winds. Landforms and bodies of water on and round the Philippines affect the strength or weakness of weather phenomenon like typhoons. Remarkably, landforms reduce the strength of typhoons whenever the winds impact them. Additionally, oceans, wherein the typhoons originate, provide advanced rainfall and strength. Large bodies of water, like oceans, seas and large lakes, can affect the climate of a section. Water heats and cools more gradually than landmasses. Therefore, the coastal regions will stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter, thus producing a more moderate climate with a narrower temperature range​</h2><br />
