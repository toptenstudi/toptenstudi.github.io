                                            What I Have Learned Now it's your time to identify the elements and principles applied in lay outing a digital poster. ___1. On the frame, the visual weight of objects, texture, colors, and space is distributed svenly / equally. Balance also applies to the arrangement of the elements of the design and a consistent visual pattern is preserved. ___2. Creating a sense of unity in the screen. Creating a sensation of coordinated motion.___3. To attract a viewer's attention, it uses many design elements.___4. In any design that appears on the screen, the color will draw the attention of the audience ___5. The emergence of a sense of organized movement ___6. The eyes of the viewers will be directed across the screen or in a certain direction in any movement of visual elements. ___7. In visual communication, it is the mark. It is used to find something as well. ___8. The sound causes a dramatic effect. We add tone when we shade a drawing to make it appear three dimensional. Tone also defines both the direction of light and the light style. In renderings, we can create a harsh or gentle light elements of design, shape, tone, line and point ___9. Identity shapes such as the square, the sphere of a pyramid. Form is formed by___10. A reflection of the surface. Identify a rough or smooth texture.​</a>

They also cut mother-of-pearl into small shapes that look like sequins called takmun to form geometric patterns. SEQUINS are disc-shaped beads. PRINCIPLE OF DESIGN: PATTERN a combination of elements of art or shapes repeated in a recurring and regular arrangement. Activity 1. Guide Questions: 1. What is TAKMUN? 2.

Form is formed by elements ofdesign, shape, tone, line and point.9. On the frame, the visual weight of objects, texture, colors, and space is distributedevenly/equally. It also applies to the arrangement of the elements of the design and aconsistent visual pattern is preserved.10. The sound causes a dramatic effect. We add tone when we shade a drawing to make itappear three dimensional. It also defines both the direction of light and the light style. Inrenderings, we can create a harsh or gentle light.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are four principles of sound design that a web design should adhere to, which are <strong>contrast</strong>, <strong>repetition</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, and <strong>proximity</strong>.</p><br />

                            2. explain principles of sound design​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Principles of Sound Design is an exploration into audio technique and creative sonic theory. The class defines sound design as a crucial aspect of film making, Integrated Digital Media, and as a unique art form. </p><p></p><p>From the history of sound design to the current trends, we embrace the creative power of sonic manipulation.</p><p> </p><p></p>Principles of Sound Design – the techniques for combining the different elements or objects. Mixing - the combination, balance and control of multiple sound elements. Pace - Time control. Editing.<br />

                            3. Discuss the elements and principles of sound design.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Ambiance - The ambiance is essentially background noise. Ideally, it should inform the viewer about where the action is taking place. Therefore it needs to inform and be descriptive without being overwhelming or distracting the viewer from the story.For example, if we are viewing a scene in a forest what are we likely to hear?</p><p>Birds tweeting in the distance and winds gently blowing would match our experience of spending time in woods.</p><p>It serves as one tool which can allow us to become more fully immersed in the story or scene as it unfolds before us.</p><p></p><p>2. Foley sounds - These are the sounds that make the scene seem more real to us.</p><p>For example, when a character walks they are not silent. We mare hear the gentle swish-swish of their clothing as they move or the sound of their footsteps on the concrete.</p><p>These are sounds that make us more readily enter the world we are faced with.</p><p>They are also sounds that can be easily recorded with a real microphone. Foley sounds also feature in a feature film in addition to animation and motion design.</p><p></p><p>3. Audio Effects (SFX) - These are sounds that are not naturally created in the real world and therefore can’t be recorded by means of a microphone.</p><p>For example, the sound of a battle in outer space is not something that can be recorded but must be imagines and recreated.</p><p></p><p>4. Voice Over - Well, these are pretty self-explanatory.</p><p>It is the narrator's voice which guides us through what is happening on the screen.</p><p>In the film, we rarely see the narrator. For example, in 500 Days of Summer, we never see the narrator but he plays a pivotal role in guiding us through the film and highlighting key moments.</p><p>Similarly in motion design, although sometimes in explainer videos we can be guided through the scene by a character who also is the narrator of the piece.</p><p></p><p>5. Music - Music is a tool we can use to set the dynamics of mood we wish to convey through the motion design piece.</p><p>What mood do we want our experience while watching the story?</p><p>This should be the first question we ask when designing the scene and also when choosing music to amplify the art.</p><br />

                            4. ALTERNATE RESPONSE, Write the word YES on your answer sheet If the statement is correct and NO if the statement is false. 1. Balance, texture, perspective and unity are design principles of visual-based presentation. 2. Cinematography is an element of visual information. 3. Each visual element must be present in a visual-based material, no matter what. 4. Elements are randomly placed I any material to be produced. 5. Interview, talking head and documentary are motion media principles. 6. Mise-en-scene and sound are principles of motion information. 7. Motion-based material does not need to include text and visual information and media. 8. One can combine several types of information and media to come up with a desired material 9. Proximity is an element rather than a principle of text-based presentation. 10. Repetition in text information serves as a reminder of important idea. 11. Selecting a style and editing are all elements of motion-based presentation, 12. The size of the page or slide is irrelevant when making text-based presentation, 13. There are five principles for manipulative-based material. 14. There are no two similar elements and/or principles in any information and media. 15. There are only two principles to be considered in audio-based presentation.​</h2><br />

They are known for embroidery, brass ornaments and beadwork that are integrated their traditional clothing. The B'laan wear clothes woven from abaca embellished with embroidery, buttons, and beads. The women wear heavy brass belts with numerous tiny bells that hang around their waisline. These produce pleasing chiming sounds when they move. They also cut mother-of-pearl into small shapes that look like sequins called takmun to form geometric patterns. SEQUINS are disc-shaped beads.
