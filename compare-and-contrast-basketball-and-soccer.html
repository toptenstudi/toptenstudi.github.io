                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Choosing between basketball and soccer depends on an individual's personal preference and physical abilities. Both sports have their unique benefits and challenges. Basketball requires quick reflexes, jumping ability, and teamwork. Soccer, on the other hand, demands endurance, agility, and skillful footwork. Ultimately, the best sport to play depends on what an individual enjoys and feels comfortable with.</p><p></p><p>2. In terms of global popularity, soccer or football is more famous than basketball. Soccer is considered the most popular sport in the world and has a massive following, particularly in Europe, South America, and Africa. Basketball, on the other hand, is popular in the United States, China, and the Philippines. While basketball has a significant global following, it doesn't have the same level of global popularity and cultural significance as soccer.</p><p></p><br />

                        The answer is quite clear as soccer and American football are two completely different games. Soccer is played with a round ball that can be kicked and headed. American football, however, is more of a rugby type game in which the oblong shaped ball is thrown and passed as well as kicked.✍<p></p><p></p>What are the difference and similarities between soccer and football?✍<p></p>Football uses the method of passing the ball using hands, whereas soccer only allows the ball to be kicked using any body parts apart from the arms and hands. Both games have teams of eleven players each, who are in opposition. Both playing fields are almost the same, but the soccer field is slightly larger.<p></p><p></p><br />
