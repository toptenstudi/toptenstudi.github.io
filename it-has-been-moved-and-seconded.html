Yataro hasbeen left motherless at an early age, and his father, though kind, wasoften too busy to take notice of him. (From "The Memory of Beauty" by Hanako Fukuda)2. By this time, darkness was coming on and, weakened and tired aswas, I lay down and fell asleep on the grass. When I awakened, it wasdaylight. I was lying on my back, and when I tried to rise, I could not..(From "Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift)3.If you can't be a highway then just be a trail,If you can't be the sun, be a star;Is isn't by the size that you win or you fail;Be the best of whatever you are!(From "Be the Best of Whatever You Are" by Douglas Malloch)4.I'm okay now that the water's back in the ocean. Did you know thatwater covers 71% of the earth's surface? Three hundred twenty-eightmillion cubic miles, to be exact. That's one billion, three hundred sixty-one million cubic kilometers. Besides, why start moving it now, when it'sbeen around almost forever? And that's no fish story. The first oceanwater came from the vapor in the atmosphere and water in rocksreleased during the earth's formation. You don't go much further intothe past than that.​</a>

                                            What I Need to Know Have you ever wondered what makes the animals move the way they do? Why do some things move faster than the others? When we ride a car why do we have to use seatbelts or wear helmets in riding motorcycles? Do we really understand why we are asked to do such? Motion has been a very familiar and common concept to all even before one has leamed to walk. But is our knowledge of the concept enough for us to understand the different kinds of motion that is happening around us? In this lesson, you will know the laws governing motion which are known as Newton's Laws of Motion. Objectives: 1 Explain Newton's first law of motion: Law of Inertia 2 Demonstrate Newton's first law of motion. 3. Appreciate the concept of Law of Inertia in real life situation 4 Explain Newton's second law of motion: Law of Acceleration 5 Solve word problems related to the Law of Acceleration 6 Practice critical thinking skill in analyzing word problems related to the Law of Acceleration​</a>

water covers 71% of the earth’s surface? Three hundred twenty-eight
million cubic miles, to be exact. That’s one billion, three hundred sixty-

Motion is the change in an object's position. in order to describean object's motion, an observer must know its position before and after it moved.For example, it is easy to say that the toy car is moving when you see it move fromone position to another. We can categorically state that there is motion.Another example is a clock. It is easy to say that the second hand of a clock ismoving because you can see it jump from one position to another. But it is noteasy to say the same thing for the hour hand. If you stare at the hour hand of aclock, it looks as though it is not moving at all. But because it changes its positionfrom one number to another, hour after hour, you can categorically state that itmoves.What you need:Figure 1Tigure 2nyPang1.

Create a TEXT class that reads, saves, and prints a given string from a stream. As its successor, define the ENCRYPTION class, which only encrypts and restores text written in Latin letters. An alphabet of Latin letters is used for encryption. The process is carried out for each letter in the text sequentially from left to right. At each step, the alphabet is moved cyclically to the left by the specified number, and the corresponding letter in the text is replaced by the letter in its position (index) in the generated alphabet. The number of alphabet swipes is given for each step. For example, the numbers 5,3,2,4 are given. In the first step, i.e. encoding the first letter of the text (let's say the letter 'A'), the alphabet is cyclically shifted 5 times to the left and replaced by the letter ('F') that appears in the place of the considered letter in the resulting alphabet. In the second step, the alphabet is moved 3 more times to the left, and so on. After the fourth step, i.e. after the alphabet has been swiped 4 times to the left, the sequence of swipes is repeated.</a>

Again, however she has a reports from her sources that they are using child labor, usually girls under 14 year old. Her third opportunity is to open a plant in Saudi Arabia. In this situation she is warned that for the operation to be successful, women should not be placed in executive positions because they would not be taken seriously by those with they had to deal.Follow the basic case study format in answering the case study:a.

                            19. Science 5, Quarter 3Read and UnderstandDESCRIBING MOTIONMotion is probably the first area in science that has been thoroughly studiedconsidering that it is one of the most common observable phenomenon in thisworld and beyond. Motion is the change in an object's position. in order to describean object's motion, an observer must know its position before and after it moved.For example, it is easy to say that the toy car is moving when you see it move fromone position to another. We can categorically state that there is motion.Another example is a clock. It is easy to say that the second hand of a clock ismoving because you can see it jump from one position to another. But it is noteasy to say the same thing for the hour hand. If you stare at the hour hand of aclock, it looks as though it is not moving at all. But because it changes its positionfrom one number to another, hour after hour, you can categorically state that itmoves.What you need:Figure 1Tigure 2nyPang1.

In Japan, more than two hundred years ago, a lonely little boy grewup to be a great man. His name was Yataro Kobayashi. Yataro hasbeen left motherless at an early age, and his father, though kind, wasoften too busy to take notice of him.

                            28. C++ Programming.
Create a TEXT class that reads, saves, and prints a given string from a stream. As its successor, define the ENCRYPTION class, which only encrypts and restores text written in Latin letters. An alphabet of Latin letters is used for encryption. The process is carried out for each letter in the text sequentially from left to right. At each step, the alphabet is moved cyclically to the left by the specified number, and the corresponding letter in the text is replaced by the letter in its position (index) in the generated alphabet. The number of alphabet swipes is given for each step. For example, the numbers 5,3,2,4 are given. In the first step, i.e. encoding the first letter of the text (let's say the letter 'A'), the alphabet is cyclically shifted 5 times to the left and replaced by the letter ('F') that appears in the place of the considered letter in the resulting alphabet. In the second step, the alphabet is moved 3 more times to the left, and so on. After the fourth step, i.e. after the alphabet has been swiped 4 times to the left, the sequence of swipes is repeated.</h2><br />
