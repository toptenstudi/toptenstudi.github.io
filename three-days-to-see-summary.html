Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

                                            " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.

adapted from The Man Who Died
by John Buchan
1 I returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it. If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick. I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been standing in the sun. Richard Hannay, I kept telling myself, you have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and you had better climb out.
2 From the first I was disappointed with the place. In about a week I was tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of restaurants and theaters. I had no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld, for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.
3 I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at my elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat1 on the top floor, with whom I had passed the time of day on the stairs.
4 "Can I speak to you?" he said. "May I come in for a minute?" He was steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.
5 I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room. Then he bolted back.
6 "Is the door locked?" he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.
7 "I'm very sorry," he said humbly. "It's a mighty liberty, but you looked the kind of man who would understand. I've had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good turn?"
8 "I'll listen to you," I said. "That's all I'll promise." I was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.
9 There was a tray of coffee on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a cup. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the cup as he set it down.
10 "Pardon," he said, "I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead."
11 "What does it feel like?" I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to deal with a madman.
12 A smile flickered over his drawn face. "I'm not mad—yet. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in."
13 "Get on with your yarn," I said, "and I'll tell you."
14 He was an American, from Kentucky, and after college, being pretty well off, he had started out to see the world. He wrote a bit, and acted as war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a year or two in South-Eastern Europe. I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts. He spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.
15 He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the interest of them, and then because he couldn't help himself. I read him as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.

Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

                            10. " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.

adapted from The Man Who Died
by John Buchan
1 I returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it. If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick. I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been standing in the sun. Richard Hannay, I kept telling myself, you have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and you had better climb out.
2 From the first I was disappointed with the place. In about a week I was tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of restaurants and theaters. I had no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld, for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.
3 I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at my elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat1 on the top floor, with whom I had passed the time of day on the stairs.
4 "Can I speak to you?" he said. "May I come in for a minute?" He was steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.
5 I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room. Then he bolted back.
6 "Is the door locked?" he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.
7 "I'm very sorry," he said humbly. "It's a mighty liberty, but you looked the kind of man who would understand. I've had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good turn?"
8 "I'll listen to you," I said. "That's all I'll promise." I was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.
9 There was a tray of coffee on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a cup. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the cup as he set it down.
10 "Pardon," he said, "I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead."
11 "What does it feel like?" I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to deal with a madman.
12 A smile flickered over his drawn face. "I'm not mad—yet. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in."
13 "Get on with your yarn," I said, "and I'll tell you."
14 He was an American, from Kentucky, and after college, being pretty well off, he had started out to see the world. He wrote a bit, and acted as war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a year or two in South-Eastern Europe. I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts. He spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.
15 He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the interest of them, and then because he couldn't help himself. I read him as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.
