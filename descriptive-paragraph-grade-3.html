                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is a little too much greed going on in society and some psychologist believed that America is the land of the greed. Greed means selfish on desire beyond reason. America is the leader of capitalism. Capitalism makes a country rich and a lot of modernized things to fit in people's daily life. The needs of those modernized things make people more greed than ever. When there's too much greed, people suffer.</p><p></p><p>On personal level, it makes people devious, petty, unlovable and very jealous. What most people want is money, lots of money, tons of money, along with the tons of things that it buys, along with the prestige that comes with having tons of money, along with the mass attention that comes along with it. As people need more money, it is not enough that they work hard at a full-time job. If they come up with a bunch of money games, and if they become very good at them, then they believe that they should be entitled to out earn their neighbors suddenly by double their amount, or triple or ten times, etc. There will be much lying, cheating, backstabbing and suffering as there needs to be until they obtain their needs.</p><p></p><p>One of the exact problems here is that people wish that other people will handle a problem. It's rather common want lost of money, as much as you can get, as much as people tell you you're entitled to. Some famous people might possibly have special needs, since ordinary people are not hounded constantly by the press and by the public. Famous people might possibly need a bigger, more secure house, as well as special transportation when the ordinary people are trying to fill their live with basic needs. Sometime, the wealth and complete life of famous people can drive crazy on the normal, ordinary citizens. </p><p></p><br />
