A physical property is a characteristic that can be determined without changing the chemical iden of a substance. 2. Plastics are flexible, durable and resilient that's why they are not good materials for storage conta The electrical conductivity is the ability of metals to conduct heat and electricity. Chemical properties are observed indirectly and become evident only when the material und chemical reaction or chemical change. 5. Durability is the ability of the materials to withstand wear, pressure or damage. 6. A change in size or shape is a physical change. 7. A chemical change means a new substance with new properties was formed. 8. An example of chemical change is when water freezes. 9. When milk turns sour, this is a physical change because a change in odor does not india change. 10.

Write your answer on the space provided. -Conductivity -Ductility · Hardness - Malleability Melting and Bolling Points Solubility Volatility Chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. There are different types of chemical bonding where one or more electrons are transferred from the metal to the non-metal to give ionic bonding. On the other hand, two identical atoms react to form a covalent bond in which electrons are shared equally. And for us to distinguish a bond we can observe their properties. The first property that we have is 1._ which is the resistance of a material to deformation of an indenter of specific size and shape under a known load. Second property which can measure an electric charge or heat that can pass through a material is called 2. Another property is the ability to be shaped, hammeredand pressed into thin sheets called 3. Then there is 4. which is the capacity to undergo change of physical form without breaking And lastly, 5.__ that is about a temperature at which material changes from a liquid to a gas and from a solid to a liquid.​</a>
