                                            Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

                                            Learning Task 3 Reading ComprehensionSolids, Liquids, and GasesMatter is basically a substance that takes up space. All matter is a solid, liquid, or gas, and they arecalled the states of matterEverywhere a person looks, there are examples of solids: desks, hairs, windows, rocks, tissues, andmuch more. Examples of liquids: water, milk, juice, chocolate sy up, soda, and others. Examples ofgases are harder to see, because they are invisible: the oxygen in the air, propane gas used for agrill, helium inside a balloon, and more.Everything, all matter, can be identified as a solid, liquid, or gas.Besides what they look like, there are many differences betwee i solids, liquids, and gases. Thesedifferences are called characteristics. The characteristics of each state of matter are different. Thesecharacteristics determine if a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas.A solid has a definite shape. It can be hard or soft, smooth or roi gh. Solids can come in all sizes. Asolid can be large like the Statue of Liberty, or small like a marble. It can be very tiny like a breadcrumb, or as big as a mountain, and everything in between. If snall enough, solids can be held in aperson's hand, and they are difficult to compress or push, or charge shape.The molecules of a solid are compact and close together, and nearly impossible to move throughA liquid takes the shape of the container it is held in, and will fil the bottom of a container. Liquidsusually have a smooth surface, but does not have a specific size. A person may be able to hold asmall amount of liquid in their hand, but a liquid cannot be held like a solid. Liquids are less difficult tocompress or push. It is much easier to move through a liquid thar a solid.The molecules of a liquid are spread out more than a solid, but less than a gas.Finally, a gas has ng shape, but can fill a container or any size or shape. It will fill an entire containeras the molecules move. A gas cannot be felt in the hands like a solid or liquid. It has no surface or noparticular size. It cannot be held in a person's hands, and it is easy to push or compress. A gas is theeasiest to move through versus a liquid or solid.The molecules in a gas are more spread out and move all the time. They are full of energy.Water is the best example of a substance that can be a solid, liqu d. or gas. Water by itself is a liquid.When water freezes it becomes a solid. If a container of water is h rated it turns into a gas called watervapor.There are many other substances that can be more than one type of matter too. Ice cream is solidthen turns into liquid, once melted. A moth ball is solid, but it rele: ses a gas that can be smelled by aperson inside the room.To summarize, the different states of matter are called solids, liqu ds, and gases. The states of matterhave different characteristics and examples of each can be found throughout the universe.Choose the letter of the correct answer.

                                            1. Any sample of matter has mass and takes up space. The main reason for this is because:      a. All matter is heavy      b Matter can be a gas      c Matter is made up of tiny particles that have mass and take up space      d The Earth is made of matter2. Water drops stay together on wax paper and they don’t break apart easily. This is mainly  because:    a Water molecules are small    b Water molecules are in motion    c Water molecules are attracted to each other    d Water molecules are wet3. When you bring two drops of water near each other and allow them to touch, they combineimmediately and become one drop. This is mainly because:    a Water molecules are made of atoms    b Water molecules are attracted to each other    c Water molecules are magnetic    d Water is a liquid4. If you put food coloring in room temperature water, the coloring spreads throughout the water. The water causes the color to spread mainly because:   a Water molecules are warm   b Water molecules are in motion   c Water is more dense than food coloring   d Food coloring molecules are small5. Food coloring spreads out faster in hot water than in cold water. This is mainly because:   a The water molecules in hot water move more quickly   b The molecules in hot water are larger  c The food coloring molecules are small  d Hot water is less dense6. When a thermometer is heated, the red liquid inside the thermometer moves up. This is mainly because:    a The red liquid is thin.    b The molecules of the liquid move faster and get a little further apart    c Hot liquid is lighter    d The glass of the thermometer gets hot7. When a thermometer is cooled, the red liquid inside the thermometer moves down. This is mainly because:     a Cold liquids sink     b The glass of the thermometer gets cold     c The molecules of the liquid move slower and get a little closer together     d The red liquid is thick8. When you heat a sample of a solid, the particles that make up the solid:      a Get bigger      b Loose mass      c Move faster      d Slow down9. When you heat a sample of a solid, the sample gets a little bigger.This is mainly because:     a The particles move faster and get a little further apart     b Heat helps the particles grow     c Heating the sample makes it lighter     d Heating helps the particles slide past each other10. When you heat a sample of gas, what happens to the particles that make up the gas?       a The particles move faster       b The particles break apart       c The particles get smaller      d The particles become more dense​</a>

                            7. Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

                            17. Learning Task 3 Reading ComprehensionSolids, Liquids, and GasesMatter is basically a substance that takes up space. All matter is a solid, liquid, or gas, and they arecalled the states of matterEverywhere a person looks, there are examples of solids: desks, hairs, windows, rocks, tissues, andmuch more. Examples of liquids: water, milk, juice, chocolate sy up, soda, and others. Examples ofgases are harder to see, because they are invisible: the oxygen in the air, propane gas used for agrill, helium inside a balloon, and more.Everything, all matter, can be identified as a solid, liquid, or gas.Besides what they look like, there are many differences betwee i solids, liquids, and gases. Thesedifferences are called characteristics. The characteristics of each state of matter are different. Thesecharacteristics determine if a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas.A solid has a definite shape. It can be hard or soft, smooth or roi gh. Solids can come in all sizes. Asolid can be large like the Statue of Liberty, or small like a marble. It can be very tiny like a breadcrumb, or as big as a mountain, and everything in between. If snall enough, solids can be held in aperson's hand, and they are difficult to compress or push, or charge shape.The molecules of a solid are compact and close together, and nearly impossible to move throughA liquid takes the shape of the container it is held in, and will fil the bottom of a container. Liquidsusually have a smooth surface, but does not have a specific size. A person may be able to hold asmall amount of liquid in their hand, but a liquid cannot be held like a solid. Liquids are less difficult tocompress or push. It is much easier to move through a liquid thar a solid.The molecules of a liquid are spread out more than a solid, but less than a gas.Finally, a gas has ng shape, but can fill a container or any size or shape. It will fill an entire containeras the molecules move. A gas cannot be felt in the hands like a solid or liquid. It has no surface or noparticular size. It cannot be held in a person's hands, and it is easy to push or compress. A gas is theeasiest to move through versus a liquid or solid.The molecules in a gas are more spread out and move all the time. They are full of energy.Water is the best example of a substance that can be a solid, liqu d. or gas. Water by itself is a liquid.When water freezes it becomes a solid. If a container of water is h rated it turns into a gas called watervapor.There are many other substances that can be more than one type of matter too. Ice cream is solidthen turns into liquid, once melted. A moth ball is solid, but it rele: ses a gas that can be smelled by aperson inside the room.To summarize, the different states of matter are called solids, liqu ds, and gases. The states of matterhave different characteristics and examples of each can be found throughout the universe.Choose the letter of the correct answer.

                            19. 1. Any sample of matter has mass and takes up space. The main reason for this is because:      a. All matter is heavy      b Matter can be a gas      c Matter is made up of tiny particles that have mass and take up space      d The Earth is made of matter2. Water drops stay together on wax paper and they don’t break apart easily. This is mainly  because:    a Water molecules are small    b Water molecules are in motion    c Water molecules are attracted to each other    d Water molecules are wet3. When you bring two drops of water near each other and allow them to touch, they combineimmediately and become one drop. This is mainly because:    a Water molecules are made of atoms    b Water molecules are attracted to each other    c Water molecules are magnetic    d Water is a liquid4. If you put food coloring in room temperature water, the coloring spreads throughout the water. The water causes the color to spread mainly because:   a Water molecules are warm   b Water molecules are in motion   c Water is more dense than food coloring   d Food coloring molecules are small5. Food coloring spreads out faster in hot water than in cold water. This is mainly because:   a The water molecules in hot water move more quickly   b The molecules in hot water are larger  c The food coloring molecules are small  d Hot water is less dense6. When a thermometer is heated, the red liquid inside the thermometer moves up. This is mainly because:    a The red liquid is thin.    b The molecules of the liquid move faster and get a little further apart    c Hot liquid is lighter    d The glass of the thermometer gets hot7. When a thermometer is cooled, the red liquid inside the thermometer moves down. This is mainly because:     a Cold liquids sink     b The glass of the thermometer gets cold     c The molecules of the liquid move slower and get a little closer together     d The red liquid is thick8. When you heat a sample of a solid, the particles that make up the solid:      a Get bigger      b Loose mass      c Move faster      d Slow down9. When you heat a sample of a solid, the sample gets a little bigger.This is mainly because:     a The particles move faster and get a little further apart     b Heat helps the particles grow     c Heating the sample makes it lighter     d Heating helps the particles slide past each other10. When you heat a sample of gas, what happens to the particles that make up the gas?       a The particles move faster       b The particles break apart       c The particles get smaller      d The particles become more dense​</h2><br />
