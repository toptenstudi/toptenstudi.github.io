Use several keywords inside quoration marks (“ ”) to focus your research results and use what you learn on one site to help you focus your next search.Double-check your information.3.Look for sites that list their references and source materials, which will explain where the author found the information. Always double-check the information you find on the internet against an offline trusted resource to make sure it is correct. Do not be fooled by misinformation.Bookmark reliable sites.4.When you find a site that is a good resource, add it to your web browser favorites orbookmarks so you can find it again easily. You never know when you need it again,and sites you know to be reliable are a great place to start when researching a newtopic.​</a>

(A Filipino Folktale)
The guavas were ripe, and Juan's father sent him to gather enough for the family and for the

began to look around for mischief. He soon found a wasp nest and managed to get it into a tight basket. He
gave it to his father as soon as he reached home, and then closed the door and fastened it.
All the neighbors were inside waiting for the feast of guavas, and as soon as the basket was opened
they began to fight to get out of the windows. After a while Juan opened the door and when he saw his
parents' swollen faces, he cried out, “What rich fine guavas those must have been! They have made you both
so very fat."

All the neighbors were inside waiting for the feast of guavas, and as soon as the basket was opened

so very fat."
