1. Multidisciplinary approaches are important in understanding and
addressing social problems.
2. The use of the different approaches in the social sciences is not
important to understand the social problems because our current social
problems are not connected with the other problems.
3. Social problems are defined by history, cultural values, cultural
universals and awareness.
4. Problems that deal with social and economic development require an
interdisciplinary approach.
5. Poverty is an example of social problem in the Philippines. A person or

                                            Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</a>

                            16. Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>environmental science is the field of science that studies the interactions of the physical, chemical, and biological components of the environment and also the relationships and effects of these components with the organisms in the environment. The field of environmental science can be divided into three main goals, which are to learn how the natural world works, to understand how we as humans interact with the environment, and also to determine how we affect the environment. The third goal of determining how humans affect the environment also includes finding ways to deal with these effects on the environment.</p><p></p><br />
