1. Some animals are nocturnal. This means that they are awake and
moving at night. Rats, mice and bats are examples of this nocturnal
animals.
2. A habitat is the natural home environment of animals. Animals have
different habitats. Birds live in nests, fishes live in water and cats live
on land. All of them can survive on their own habitat.
3.Yesterday was Anthony’s 10th birthday. He had three wishes. His
first wish, was good health for his family. Second, that his father will
be able to find a job. Lastly, that this pandemic will end.
4.There are many reasons why people dance. Some dance for fun,
because they enjoy it. Others dance for exercise and weight loss .
Dancing can really get your heart beating. These are the reasons why
people dance.
5.As I was running along the road, I remembered that I had left my
lunch box on the kitchen table. I had to go back and get it. When I
arrived home, I saw the clock, and knew I was going to be late. I arrived
after the teacher had begun her presentation.
6.It was early in the morning. Joan woke up with a hungry stomach.
She got dressed and went to the kitchen. She prepared a small pan
and fried some dried fish and eggs. After that, Joan put two pieces of
pandesal on a plate and ate them with a cup of milk.
7.As a Grade five pupil, Ellaine was already self -motivated and self -
directed in many ways. She would assist her mother in some
household chores and some errands. 
On days when there would be no
classes, she would go with her father in the market and would help
sell meat and vegetables. On weekdays, she would study her lessons
and do her assignments by herself.
8.Last night, was my Lola’s 70th birthday. Her children and
grandchildren sponsored it. Around 5:30 PM, we began gathering
around the kitchen. My brother and I sang a beautiful song for her. At
6:30 we started to give her birthday gifts then we had dinner at 7:00.
My Lola was so happy while opening all of her gifts. It was indeed a
joyous celebration.
9.Lightning and thunder are related events. 
Lightning is a sudden, violent
flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or
between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long
and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature
of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt
to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that
we hear as thunder.
10.All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.
Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will
still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does
not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter
into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when
paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</a>

                                            Read the article about soot as lens cleaner. Soot as Lens Cleaner Most of the youth are now engaged in photography. Behind a great photo is a good camera. One of the ways to take care of this tool is to clean its lens, which is a very sensitive part of the camera. We can also make an alternative lens cleaner by using a candle, spoon, and a soft cloth. You have to collect soot from the candle by setting the spoon directly on fire. Gather the black matter or soot that builds up on the spoon. Soot is a black powdery substance made of carbon, produced by the incomplete burning of organic substances. Commercial lens cleaners have carbon particles that efficiently clean oil smudges an fingerprints. Thus, using microfiber cloth and candle soot that possess the same basic carbon ingredient as the commercial lens cleaners will make a good alternative (source: S&amp;T Digest (Grade 7), Volume 24 Issue 3 (November-December 2019): p. 12) There are many substances around you that are amazingly useful just like the soot dis- cussed in the article. For this activity, your task is to choose one substance found in your home. Write a short article about it to discuss its composition, properties, and uses. Write your article on a sheet of paper and submit a copy to your teacher for checking. ​</a>

1. Some animals are nocturnal. This means that they are awake and moving at night. Rats, mice and bats are examples of this nocturnal animals.
2. Yesterday was Anthony’s 10th birthday. He had three wishes. His first wish, was good health for his family. Second, that his father will be able to find a job. Lastly, that this pandemic will end.
3. A habitat is the natural home environment of animals. Animals have different habitats. Birds live in nests, fishes live in water and cats live on land. All of them can survive on their own habitat.
4. There are some months in a year when we experience rain. These are June, July, August, September, October and November. There are also months when there is less rain or no rain at all. These are the months of December, January, February, March, April and May. These are the summer and the rainy months.
5. As I was running along the road, I remembered that I had left my lunch box on the kitchen table. I had to go back and get it. When I arrived home, I saw the clock, and knew I was going to be late. I arrived after the teacher had begun her presentation.
6. It was early in the morning. Joan woke up with a hungry stomach. She got dressed and went to the kitchen. She prepared a small pan, and fried some dried fish and eggs. After that, Joan put two pieces of pandesal on a plate and ate them with a cup of milk
7. Last night, was my Lola’s 70th birthday. Her children and grandchildren sponsored it. Around 5:30 PM, we began gathering around the kitchen. My brother and I sang a beautiful song for her. At 6:30 we started to give her birthday gifts then we had dinner at 7:00. My Lola was so happy while opening all of her gifts. It was indeed a joyous celebration.
8. As a Grade five pupil, Ellaine was already self -motivated and self - directed in many ways. She would assist her mother in some household chores and some errands. On days when there would be no classes, she would go with her father in the market and would help sell meat and vegetables. On weekdays, she would study her lessons and does her assignments by herself.
9. Lightning and thunder are related events. Lightning is a sudden, violent flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that we hear as thunder.
10. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</a>

_____ 9. Lightning and thunder are related events. Lightning is a sudden, violent flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that we hear as thunder.
_____ 10. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</a>

In Science class, Jennie's teacher asked them to group themselves into five for an experiment about properties of matter. They have learned that the ability of materials to absorb water is due to the presence of loose fibers with lots of pores or holes between the particles that make the materials. Examples of materials that absorb water are tissue paper, cottons, and cloth; they are called porous materials. On the other hand, materials that do not absorb water or liquid are called non-porous materials, examples of which are plastic or metal spoons, porcelains, cups, and glasses.that is for grade 5 not grade 3 or 4 ok</a>

first wish, was good health for his family. Second, that his father will
be able to find a job. Lastly, that this pandemic will end.
4.There are many reasons why people dance. Some dance for fun,
because they enjoy it. Others dance for exercise and weight loss .
Dancing can really get your heart beating. These are the reasons why
people dance.
5.As I was running along the road, I remembered that I had left my
lunch box on the kitchen table. I had to go back and get it. When I
arrived home, I saw the clock, and knew I was going to be late. I arrived
after the teacher had begun her presentation.
6.It was early in the morning. Joan woke up with a hungry stomach.
She got dressed and went to the kitchen. She prepared a small pan
and fried some dried fish and eggs. After that, Joan put two pieces of
pandesal on a plate and ate them with a cup of milk.
7.As a Grade five pupil, Ellaine was already self -motivated and self -
directed in many ways. She would assist her mother in some
household chores and some errands. 
On days when there would be no
classes, she would go with her father in the market and would help
sell meat and vegetables. On weekdays, she would study her lessons
and do her assignments by herself.
8.Last night, was my Lola’s 70th birthday. Her children and
grandchildren sponsored it. Around 5:30 PM, we began gathering
around the kitchen. My brother and I sang a beautiful song for her. At
6:30 we started to give her birthday gifts then we had dinner at 7:00.
My Lola was so happy while opening all of her gifts. It was indeed a
joyous celebration.
9.Lightning and thunder are related events. 
Lightning is a sudden, violent
flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or
between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long
and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature
of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt
to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that
we hear as thunder.
10.All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.
Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will
still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does
not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter
into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when
paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</h2><br />

                            8. Read the article about soot as lens cleaner. Soot as Lens Cleaner Most of the youth are now engaged in photography. Behind a great photo is a good camera. One of the ways to take care of this tool is to clean its lens, which is a very sensitive part of the camera. We can also make an alternative lens cleaner by using a candle, spoon, and a soft cloth. You have to collect soot from the candle by setting the spoon directly on fire. Gather the black matter or soot that builds up on the spoon. Soot is a black powdery substance made of carbon, produced by the incomplete burning of organic substances. Commercial lens cleaners have carbon particles that efficiently clean oil smudges an fingerprints. Thus, using microfiber cloth and candle soot that possess the same basic carbon ingredient as the commercial lens cleaners will make a good alternative (source: S&amp;T Digest (Grade 7), Volume 24 Issue 3 (November-December 2019): p. 12) There are many substances around you that are amazingly useful just like the soot dis- cussed in the article. For this activity, your task is to choose one substance found in your home. Write a short article about it to discuss its composition, properties, and uses. Write your article on a sheet of paper and submit a copy to your teacher for checking. ​</h2><br />

For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</h2><br />

In Science class, Jennie's teacher asked them to group themselves into five for an experiment about properties of matter. They have learned that the ability of materials to absorb water is due to the presence of loose fibers with lots of pores or holes between the particles that make the materials. Examples of materials that absorb water are tissue paper, cottons, and cloth; they are called porous materials. On the other hand, materials that do not absorb water or liquid are called non-porous materials, examples of which are plastic or metal spoons, porcelains, cups, and glasses.that is for grade 5 not grade 3 or 4 ok</h2><br />
