                        Factors Affecting Gas Pressure:<p>If each containers is airtight and has the same number of gas molecules, then <strong>the smallest container has the highest pressure.</strong></p><p><strong>One factor that affects the pressure is the volume of the container.</strong> If the volume of a container is decreased, the gas molecules have less space in which to move around. As a result, they will strike the walls of the container more often and the pressure increases. Likewise, the bigger the container, the  greater the space in which the gas molecules can move around and there is a lesser chance for them to strike the walls of the container and the pressure decreases.</p><p>The <strong>volume of a particular container is measured by the amount of liquid it can contain. </strong>This is often expressed in cubic units. Aside from the volume of the container, <strong>the amount of gas and temperature also affects gas pressure. </strong>Considering that gas particles move randomly and in straight lines until they elastically collide with either other gas particles or with one of the walls of the container. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now much stronger than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> pressure, volume</p><p>What is Pressure: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2628921</strong></p><p><strong>#LearnWithBrainly</strong></p><br />
