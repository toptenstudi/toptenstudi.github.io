                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Any three causes of the First World War are as follows:</p><p></p><p>i) Militant nationalism: it emerged in Europe in the latter part of the 19th century. It meant outright wars by the European countries to achieve their goals. Militant nationalism was caused by aggressive nationalism, economic competition and international tension. </p><p></p><p>Aggressive nationalism meant love for your own country and hatred of other countries. Each nation thought about its own interests and did not care for the interests of other nations. </p><p></p><p>Fierce economic competition among the nations also led to the rise of militant nationalism. Countries such as Germany, Italy, Russia, etc. wanted to increase their spheres of influence in Asia and Africa like England and France. This led to a clash of interest among the countries. </p><p></p><p>ii) Race for armaments in the beginning of the 20th century: The mad race for armaments which began soon after the Franco-Prussian war was one of the reasons for the First World War. Every major power began stockpiling arms in the name of self-defence and preservation of peace.As a result if one country increased its armaments , other countries were compelled to do the same. It filled the atmosphere with fear, apprehension and mutual hatred.</p><p></p><p>iii) The Balkan crisis: The east European region under the empire of Turkey was known as the 'Balkan Area.' Due to geographical importance of this area, England, France and Russia interfered into the politics of this area. The people in this region had begun a national movement against Turkey rule. On knowing this, Russia began to exert pressure on Balkan region as the citizens of this region were slav by race. Russia was dreaming of a bigger slav nation. England and France felt that the route to Asia via Mediterranean sea would thus be endangered for their interest as they had colonies in Asia. The boundary of Austria-Hungary was touching the Balkan region. Austria saw this as an easy opportunity to expand her territories. Serbia was also wanting to expand her territories. They both were keen on Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the year 1908, a political revolution broke out in Turkey. Taking full advantage of this situation, Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina which were very much coveted by Serbia. This led to enmity between Austria and Serbia ultimately leading to World War 1.</p><p></p><p>c) Any three clauses of the Treaty of Versailles:</p><p></p><p>i) The Treaty declared Germany guilty of aggression.</p><br />

                        Answer<p>Name: Vincent Van Gogh</p><p>Title: Starry Night</p><p>Year: 1889</p><p>Medium and Material: Oil-on-canvas</p>Description<p>The Starry Night is the most famous painting of Vincent Van Gogh. The dominant trait of the painting is the night sky with swirling clouds, a glowing moon, and huge radiating stars.</p>Analysis<p>The Starry Night was painted base on Van Gogh's view from the window of his room in a mental asylum at Saint-Remy. Van Gogh was recovering from mental illness and his ear amputation. Many scholars linked his death to the symbolism of the stylized cypress tree in the foreground. The night skies represent Van Gogh's feeling to overcome his mental illness.</p>Interpretation<p>The light sources of Starry Night may represent Van Gogh's hope of getting cured. However, the peaceful vibe of the painting gives an impression that Van Gogh is ready to die. For me, this painting is like a final farewell of Vincent Van Gogh.</p>Judgement<p>Van Gogh's Starry Night is Beautiful, and is worthy to be called one of the most valuable paintings of mankind. The Starry Night still remains enigmatic because of Van Gogh's suicide.</p><p></p><p><strong>A Book That Many Hates -</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/2903514</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
