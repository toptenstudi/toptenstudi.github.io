                                            TRUE OR FALSE Write true if the statement is true and false if it is wrong. 1. All four wheels of a car run on hub bearings which allow them to rotate, but it is the kingpin which allows the front wheels to turn with the steering wheel. 2. Vibration in the steering wheel is also caused by tire imbalance or a bent wheel. 3. Kingpins by design need regular maintenance in the form of greasing, ideally every 1500 miles. 4. If any play found is only slight, this may be overcome by greasing the kingpin to take up the play 5. Painting will be one step on the way to making your car concourse or suitable for showing. 6. Kingpin wear inspection requires that no weight be on the axle; so jacking up the front of the truck is required. 7. Follow truck-lifting procedures in your vehicle's operating manual to properly lift the truck. 8. Improper lubrication of king pin bushings can cause king pin contact points to start to wear at the steering knuckle. 9. If you're experiencing symptoms of a king pin and bushing failure, additional inspection must be done to rule out other wheel assembly issues that may cause similar symptoms. 10.An easy way to help determine a worn king pin is to conduct a king pin wear inspection.​</a>

                                            This is the story                       THE SINGASang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam,       which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.       Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).        The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.        "What is the name of that island?"                  The subject looked into the distance   and smiled. "That is Temasek, Your   Highness." "Then we are going there." The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black cloudy, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails. started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king's head He semembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a greature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening before before leaping into the jungle.​</a>

Don Juan had followed his brothers in their journey in search of the Adarna bird whose song could supposedly cure the king's illness. He caught the Adarna bird with the help of an old man and a hermit. Don Pedro and Don Diego had earlier been transformed into stones when the droppings of the Adama bird fell on them while they were sleeping. They returned to their human form after Don Juan had poured on them water from the well in Tabor. The two elder brothers got the Adarna bird from the unconscious Don Juan and brought it to the palace, claiming success in their search. But the Adarna bird refused to sing and instead told the king the whole story. The king was enraged, but Don Juan pardoned his two brothers as an act of love and mercy for them.

 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

STORY:
THE ‘SINGA’ 
Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and
wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.
Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving
the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only
grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag
up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.
“What is the name of that island?” The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.”
“Then we are going there.” The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship
carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his
grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his
crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown
immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear
and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and
the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and
moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red
body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden
eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle.
“What sort of animal was that?”, the king asked. A wise old man stepped forth.
I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.”
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live

All four wheels of a car run on hub bearings which allow them to rotate, but it is the kingpin which allows the front wheels to turn with the steering wheel. 2. Vibration in the steering wheel is also caused by tire imbalance or a bent wheel. 3. Kingpins by design need regular maintenance in the form of greasing, ideally every 1500 miles. 4. If any play found is only slight, this may be overcome by greasing the kingpin to take up the play 5. Painting will be one step on the way to making your car concourse or suitable for showing. 6. Kingpin wear inspection requires that no weight be on the axle; so jacking up the front of the truck is required. 7. Follow truck-lifting procedures in your vehicle's operating manual to properly lift the truck. 8. Improper lubrication of king pin bushings can cause king pin contact points to start to wear at the steering knuckle. 9. If you're experiencing symptoms of a king pin and bushing failure, additional inspection must be done to rule out other wheel assembly issues that may cause similar symptoms. 10.An easy way to help determine a worn king pin is to conduct a king pin wear inspection.​</h2><br />

                            17. This is the story                       THE SINGASang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam,       which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.       Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).        The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.        "What is the name of that island?"                  The subject looked into the distance   and smiled. "That is Temasek, Your   Highness." "Then we are going there." The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black cloudy, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails. started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king's head He semembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a greature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening before before leaping into the jungle.​</h2><br />

 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

STORY:
THE ‘SINGA’ 
Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and
wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.
Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving
the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only
grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag
up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.
“What is the name of that island?” The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.”
“Then we are going there.” The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship
carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his
grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his
crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown
immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear
and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and
the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and
moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red
body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden
eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle.
“What sort of animal was that?”, the king asked. A wise old man stepped forth.
