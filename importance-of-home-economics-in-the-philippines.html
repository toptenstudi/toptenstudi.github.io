The most important Christmas decoration in most homes is the presents under the tree, not the baby Jesus in the nativity scene or the angel on top of the tree. Christmas should be about the things Jesus taught, about giving, not getting, about being together, not spending money on each other.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. MANILA -- When the Philippines' telecom challenger DITO Telecommunity picked March 28 to showcase its brand new network, the date was carefully chosen to honor the man who made it all possible -- Rodrigo Duterte. Timing it with the Philippine President's birthday would show the close ties between the leader and China Telecom-backed DITO, the company Duterte is hoping will break up the country's long-standing telecom duopoly. But what the company had hoped would be a splash became instead a low-key "internal" event after most areas in the country were put on lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19. Nor is it the only milestone the company has struggled to hit. A "technical audit" scheduled for July 8 to confirm DITO's physical network was in place and ready to operate has been pushed back to January 2021, as only a quarter of its planned towers have been built. Definitely, this will resolve communication problems in the country when fully operational.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

                            2. What are the Importance of home economics  Philippines education? Essay pahelp po please​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I strongly believe that home economics has an extremely important place in our educational system today. No other academic discipline incorporates in its curriculum as many pertinent life skills that will help students succeed independent of their chosen career paths. Referring back to past studies and my own personal beliefs, I hope to help the reader understand the benefits of receiving an education in home economics and how the knowledge obtained through this program will prove valuable throughout the lifespan.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, the most important aspect of a home economics education is that students not only learn about subject matter that has relevance to their present lives, but will constantly be of use as they continue to grow. One area of home economics that is considered to be among the most essential is the emphasis on personal development, decision making and intrapersonal skills. According to a study done in Japan, students’ personal initiatives play an extremely large role in determining how they’ll react to their changing work situations (1). Those who lack the ability to make effective personal decisions are more at risk for experiencing hardships in the instabilities found in the real world. It was also found in the study that students do not feel they have the proper means to learn these valuable life skills at home (1). Taking courses in home economics at school allows students to acquire the necessary decision making, social, and communications skills deemed critical for occupational success.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the development of valuable intrapersonal skills, the home economics curriculum also introduces the students to a wide variety of potential career paths. Students become aware of all the career opportunities relating to each domain, as well as being taught the skills associated with them. Those who find themselves intrigued by course material may begin to consider an occupation in a related area. The home economics discipline has led individuals to the fields of education, nutrition, social service, and hospitality management, to name a few (8). It is hard to find a single subject taught in schools today that incorporates as many topics of interest as home economics, helping students to become more well-rounded individuals.</p><p></p><p>Consumer-related material covered in home economics courses is another area that provides students with information pertinent to their lives as adults. These programs help supply the students with an understanding on how economic, social, and cultural factors personally affect them and their behaviors in consumerism (5). While other academic courses may cover theoretical aspects personal finance, home economics gives a more practical, everyday application of the subject matter. However, there have been some criticisms to how useful learning about consumerism as adolescents actually is. Research on Finnish students showed that motivation to study consumerism in school was not particularly high, because they felt true consumerism started at adulthood (2). Despite the attitudes of this sample, I do believe children in home economics programs can benefit from learning purchasing practices at a young age. Because of its real-world applications, students may find these techniques conducive to their everyday lives.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I HOPE IT'S HELP</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Having the knowledge of how to cook and manage aspects of a household through a class is vital in today’s society. Although many may think that a class isn’t needed to teach about the basic necessities, having a class solely devoted to these aspects is exactly what we need in school.</p><p></p><p>Things like learning how to make more than a grilled cheese or how to sew is something that everyone should learn at a young age.</p><p></p><p>In home economics, students develop an understanding of the factors that influence the well-being of individuals and families within the home and community and of the actions people take to enhance and sustain those environments. ... Many teachers of home economics are also teachers of food technology and hospitality.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> 3 pharagro essay ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ</p><p></p><br />

Holy Week is the last week of Lent and is very important in our religious calendar. On Palm Sunday, accompanied by his disciples, Jesus entered Jerusalem while people lined the streets and waved palms, leaves and olive branches. On Holy Thursday, he washed the feet of his friends. On Good Friday, he was whipped and forced to carry the heavy wooden cross to Golgotha, where he was nailed and left to die. 12. The world has experienced a prolonged period of uncertainty and unrest caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, it has already affected the lives of people in almost 200 countries globally. The human cost is rapidly being matched by huge economic costs. 13. Is the use of cellphones necessary in school? While others agree on the use of cellphones of the learners in school, many are still not in favor of the idea for a simple reason that it will only distract them from focusing on the different school activities. Banning the use of it inside the classroom is a good way of focusing on acquiring foundational learning skills that the students need. 14. Depression affects how people think, feel and act. Depression makes it more difficult to manage from day to day and interferes with study, work and relationships. A person may be depressed if for more than two weeks they have felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or have lost interest or pleasure in most of their usual activities. 15.Mayon Volcano is well-known around the world as the "perfect cone" volcano due to its almost symmetric conical shape- a unique feature.

Formulate your own opinion and compare it with the writer’s. Write your answers on the space provided.Christmas is all about money and material things these days. Parents spend all their time and money trying to get the latest, most exciting gifts for their children. Children think about nothing but what their relatives and friends will give them. The most important Christmas decoration in most homes is the presents under the tree, not the baby Jesus in the nativity scene or the angel on top of the tree. Christmas should be about the things Jesus taught, about giving, not getting, about being together, not spending money on each other.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. MANILA -- When the Philippines' telecom challenger DITO Telecommunity picked March 28 to showcase its brand new network, the date was carefully chosen to honor the man who made it all possible -- Rodrigo Duterte. Timing it with the Philippine President's birthday would show the close ties between the leader and China Telecom-backed DITO, the company Duterte is hoping will break up the country's long-standing telecom duopoly. But what the company had hoped would be a splash became instead a low-key "internal" event after most areas in the country were put on lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19. Nor is it the only milestone the company has struggled to hit. A "technical audit" scheduled for July 8 to confirm DITO's physical network was in place and ready to operate has been pushed back to January 2021, as only a quarter of its planned towers have been built. Definitely, this will resolve communication problems in the country when fully operational.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />

                        <p></p><strong>Government strategies to fight climate change</strong><p></p><p>As one of the world’s most vulnerable nations, the Philippines is strongly committed to addressing the threat of climate change. It is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, which set targets for the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p>To meet its national development goals and international commitments, the government established crucial legal and institutional frameworks for climate mitigation and adaptation in the country. Guided by these laws and strategies, climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction measures have been included in the Philippine Development Plan for 2017-2022.</p><p></p><p>In 2016, the Philippine Senate ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, and in 2017, the Paris Agreement. Following this, Philippine policymakers proposed nationally determined contributions to help achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. These focused on promoting energy efficiency; improving transport systems; shifting to cleaner fuels and vehicles; improving solid waste management and wastewater treatment; ensuring forest protection, restoration and rehabilitation; and adopting climate-resilient agriculture practices.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><br />

economic factors.
A. culture B. history C. economic D. environment
1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.
