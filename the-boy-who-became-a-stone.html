                                            Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</a>

                                            1. Dogedog had always been very lazy, and now that his father and mother were dead and he had no one to care for him, he livevery poorly. He had little to eat. His house was old and small andso poor that it had not even a floor. Still he would rather sit allday and idle away his time than to work and have more things.(Dogedog, a Tinguian folktale)2. Long time ago, there was a man named Lam-ang who started tosearch for his lost father. His father was murdered by the headhunting Igorots in the Igorot country. (Biag ni Lam-ang, an Ilocano epic)3. One day a little boy named Elonen sat out in the yard making abird snare, and as he worked, a little bird called to him: "Tik-tiklo-den" (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," saidthe boy; but the bird continued to call until the snare wasfinished. (The Boy Who Became a Stone, a Tinguian folktale)4. One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, hemet a shell and they began talking together. "You are very slow,"said the carabao to the shell. (The Carabao and the Shell, aTinguian folktale)5. "Oh, no," replied the shell. "I can beat you in a race. "When theworld first began there was no land, but only the sea and the sky,and between them was a kite. One day the bird had nowhere toalight grew tired of flying about, so she stirred up the sea until itthrew its waters against the sky. (The Creation Story, a Filipinofolktale)a.

                                            David and GoliathDuring the time when the story of David and Goliath took place there was a war betweenthe Philistines and the Israelites. The two armies set up their camps between the cities of Sokohand Azekah. The Bible says there was a Philistine warior named Golath that was over 9 feettall!

                                            Summarize the given text belowThe Boy Who Became a StoneOne day, a little boy named Eloden sat out in the yard making a bird snare. As he worked, a little bird called to him. Tik-tik-lo-den (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," said the boy, but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished. Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is." Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabaos and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it, and the thunder which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.​</a>

                                            GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5. Why do they sometimes go to Mount Olympus?​</a>

                                            Summarize the given Text belowThe Boy Who Became a Stone One day, a little boy named Eloden sat out in the yard making a bird snare. As he worked, a little bird called to him. Tik-tik-lo-den (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," said the boy, but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished. Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is." Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabaos and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it, and the thunder which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.​</a>

                            6. Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</h2><br />

Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is."

                            17. GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5.
