Is chivalry still true today? Explain briefly.Concept Development Task 4: QUICK WRITESWhat is a critique? A critique is a paper that gives a critical assessment of a book or article. A critique is a systematic analysis of a piece of literature that discusses itsvalidity and evaluates its worth.Its main purpose is not informational, but analytic and persuasive In analyzing the content and context within which the book (or article) was written, the writer of acritique argues whether it is worth reading or not.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Training of a page, an esquire, and a knight:</p><p>A page was a young boy who began his training in a noble household at around the age of seven. He learned how to read and write, basic math, and social skills. He also learned how to ride horses and care for them, as well as how to hunt and use weapons. He served the lord and lady of the household and learned etiquette and manners.</p><p>An esquire was the next rank up from a page and usually started their training around the age of 14. They learned more advanced combat skills, such as jousting, sword fighting, and archery, as well as strategy and tactics. They also learned about chivalry and how to serve their lord and lady with honor and loyalty.</p><p>A knight was the highest rank and usually achieved around the age of 21. They were expected to be expert warriors and also uphold the ideals of chivalry, such as bravery, loyalty, and honor. They were expected to protect the weak and innocent and fight for justice and righteousness.</p><p>The aspects of training that are relevant to our youth include learning basic skills, such as reading and writing, as well as social skills, such as etiquette and manners. Youth can also benefit from learning about teamwork, leadership, and loyalty, as well as developing physical skills and discipline through activities like sports or martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Chivalry as an ideal may not be as prevalent today as it was in medieval times, but its principles of honor, loyalty, and selflessness are still relevant and can be applied in modern contexts. Examples of chivalrous behavior could include standing up for someone who is being bullied, being honest and fair in one's dealings, and serving others in need.</p><p></p><p>A critique is a systematic analysis of a piece of literature, film, or other media that evaluates its worth and validity. It is not merely informational, but rather aims to persuade the reader of the writer's assessment. A critique typically includes the following elements:</p><p></p><p>Title, author, and date of publication or release</p><p>Outline of the main ideas and thesis of the work</p><p>The writer's own thesis statement and main idea about the work</p><p>Analysis of what the writer likes and dislikes about the work, with specific examples to support their assessment</p><p>Assessment of whether the author or creator achieved their intended goal, such as informing or entertaining the audience</p><p>Evaluation of the work's focus, clarity, persuasiveness, originality, and other relevant factors</p><p>In writing a critique, it is important to approach the work objectively and provide evidence to support one's assessment. A critique can be a useful tool for evaluating and improving one's own writing or other creative endeavors.</p><p></p><br />
