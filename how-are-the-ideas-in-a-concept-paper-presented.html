                            29. DAY 2LESSON PROPER:Textual aids refer to non-textual elements that help readersunderstand the content of the text. They also refer to elements thatstand- out from the main text such as titles and subtitles, bold,italicized and underlined texts. Non-textual elements includeillustrations, maps, tables, graphs and charts.These aids have two main functions, namely: first, to direct the readers"attention to important ideas in the text and second, to provide moreinformation as a supplement to what is already written.1. Titles and subtitles provide initial idea on what the text is all about, thusactivating what the readers already know about the topic. According to EliteEditing (2015), these aids "represent the key concepts (title) and supportingideas (subtitles) in the paper". The layering or positioning of these aidsconvey the ideas" level ofimportance and their prominent text formatdistinguish the idea that they contain from the rest of the text.Here is an interactive example so that you will understand betterhow titles and subtitles work as textual aids.NOTE TO LEARNERS: notice how the titles and subtitlespresented below and think of the answers to the questions thatfollow. Discussion of the answers follows after the example.1. What do you notice with these textual aids? How do theylook like?2. Between Title 1 and Title 2, which do you think is theoverall title of the article? Why do you say so?3. From all the titles, which are the key concepts and whichare the supporting details? Why do you say so?4. Based on how the sample is presented, do you think thepositioning of these titles is correct and appropriate? Whydo you say so?5. Given the titles and subtitles, what do you think is thearticle about? What do you already know about it?​</h2><br />
