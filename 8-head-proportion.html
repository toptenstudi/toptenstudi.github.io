When I turned 2 years old, I begun to walk more like an adult because the bones and muscles are gradually developing.3-8 Years OldDuring this early stage, my legs and trunks will continue to grow, and heads are not so large in proportion to my body. After this, my body gradually increase its strength and hand dexterity through physical activities. It also improves my coordination and reaction time. Increase in large-muscle coordination, leading to success in organized sports and games.9-11 Years OldI have experience a growth spurt with significant weight gain, muscle growth, and genital maturation.12-18 Years OldIn the early stage, my height and weight will increase slowly. During the puberty stage, my arms, legs, hands, and feet also grow faster than the rest of my body. </a>

The two legs moveon a pivot so that the items of various sizes can be gripped.7. This wrench uses compressed air to turn nuts, bolts, and other objectsquickly and powerfully.8. It is used for cleaning the floor and car interiors after service.9. It can either be bench-mounted or installed on a pedestal. It mayeither have a grinding wheel, view wheel, or two grinding wheels10. This uses compressed air to flow into the jack cylinder and causesthe ram to extend and raise the vehicle.11. It is a component of a solution that dissolves solute and is usually inlarge proportions or amounts. It can be classified as polar or nonpolar.12. It is a substance introduced to lessen friction between movingsurfaces. It may also transport external particles.13.

When I turned 2 years old, I begun to walk more like an adult because the bones and muscles are gradually developing.3-8 Years OldDuring this early stage, my legs and trunks will continue to grow, and heads are not so large in proportion to my body. After this, my body gradually increase its strength and hand dexterity through physical activities. It also improves my coordination and reaction time. Increase in large-muscle coordination, leading to success in organized sports and games.9-11 Years OldI have experience a growth spurt with significant weight gain, muscle growth, and genital maturation.12-18 Years OldIn the early stage, my height and weight will increase slowly. During the puberty stage, my arms, legs, hands, and feet also grow faster than the rest of my body. </h2><br />
