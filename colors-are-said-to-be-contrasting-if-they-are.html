The fox seated himself beneath the tree, looked up at him, and began to praise him. "Your color," he began," pure black This proven to me that you possess all the wisdom of Laotrse, who knows how to shroud his learning in darkness. The manner in which you manage to feed your mother shows that your mal affection equals that which the Master Dsong had for his parents. Your voice is rough and strong. It proves that you have the courage with which King Hiang once drove his foes to flight by the mere sound of his voice in truth, you are the king of birds! The raven hearing this, was filled with joy and said "I thank youll thank you! And before he knew it, the meat fell to earth from his opened beak The fox caught it up, devoured it and then said, laughing "Make note of this, my dear sir if someone praises you without occasion, he is sure to have a reason for doing so."​</a>
