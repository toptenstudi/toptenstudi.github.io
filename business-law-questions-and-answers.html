                                            On a given day, Rose Restaurant is full of customers. It is not surprising because of two factors: first, its location in the center of the commercial district in Santiago City, and second, the dynamism of its owner and manager, Ms. Rosemarie Ginez. She is more than happy because she was able to realize her dream of becoming successful in the food business. She now owns the building and the lot she used to rent. Served in its large air-conditioned functions hall are native and Chinese delicacies. The place has ample parking space for 20 cars.	It was on the restaurant where she first met her future husband. He is government employee and is assigned to work nearby town. Rose’s husband is a native of San Jose City and his widowed mother is operating a big palay trading firm. Apart from owning 10 cargo trucks, his mother also owns one and a half hectares of commercial land in the city’s business district.	Just as Rose was considering opening a branch of her restaurant in Cauayan City, her mother-in-law died. Two weeks later, her husband informed her that being the heir, he needs to move quickly to San Jose City and manage his mother’s business and other properties.	Even if her husband operates her mother’s business, Rose could still continue managing her restaurant. Both of them, however, are aware of the difficulty of maintaining two businesses which are four hours away by car from each other. They will miss each other for days every week if they decide to keep both businesses. Her husband is indifferent, however, on whatever Rose’s decision will be. 	Rose in now mulling over her family’s chances of succeeding in business if she decides on maintaining only the palay trading firm. Her decision-making is made more complicated when her assistant reported 49% increase in last year’s profits of her restaurant. Question:*If you were Rose, what additional information would you need before making a decision?Answer:​</a>

(3)This happensbecause people are lazy, have busy lives, and buy products with excessive packaging.(4) If people knew there was an immediate consequence for this waste, they would bemore inclined to recycle. (5) We must acknowledge that no one likes to pay a fine orhave the government tell them what to do, but if recycling were required, we couldreduce the amount of trash produced by at least 50%.(6) The best solution to curbingpollution is to enforce recycling by law.1.

                                            Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.

                        ✏Answer✏<p>4.In legal terms, prestation refers to the act of performing or fulfilling an obligation or duty. It is an essential element of a contract, wherein one party agrees to provide goods, services, or perform an act, while the other party is obligated to pay for or compensate for such performance.</p><p></p><p>5.Consideration, in the context of business law, refers to something of value that is given or promised by one party in exchange for the promise or performance of another party. It is a crucial element of a contract, and it can take the form of money, goods, services, or a promise to do or refrain from doing something. Consideration is necessary to create a legally binding contract, as it signifies that there has been a bargained-for exchange between the parties involved. Without consideration, a contract may be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>paki brainliest po thank u &lt;3<br />

                            11. On a given day, Rose Restaurant is full of customers. It is not surprising because of two factors: first, its location in the center of the commercial district in Santiago City, and second, the dynamism of its owner and manager, Ms. Rosemarie Ginez. She is more than happy because she was able to realize her dream of becoming successful in the food business. She now owns the building and the lot she used to rent. Served in its large air-conditioned functions hall are native and Chinese delicacies. The place has ample parking space for 20 cars.	It was on the restaurant where she first met her future husband. He is government employee and is assigned to work nearby town. Rose’s husband is a native of San Jose City and his widowed mother is operating a big palay trading firm. Apart from owning 10 cargo trucks, his mother also owns one and a half hectares of commercial land in the city’s business district.	Just as Rose was considering opening a branch of her restaurant in Cauayan City, her mother-in-law died. Two weeks later, her husband informed her that being the heir, he needs to move quickly to San Jose City and manage his mother’s business and other properties.	Even if her husband operates her mother’s business, Rose could still continue managing her restaurant. Both of them, however, are aware of the difficulty of maintaining two businesses which are four hours away by car from each other. They will miss each other for days every week if they decide to keep both businesses. Her husband is indifferent, however, on whatever Rose’s decision will be. 	Rose in now mulling over her family’s chances of succeeding in business if she decides on maintaining only the palay trading firm. Her decision-making is made more complicated when her assistant reported 49% increase in last year’s profits of her restaurant. Question:*If you were Rose, what additional information would you need before making a decision?Answer:​</h2><br />

                            17. Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.
