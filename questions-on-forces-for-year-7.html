It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.3;The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace .4;The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.5;And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture. 6;The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.7;Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.Questions:1.What was the argument of the bamboo and the Mango tree?2.What word in paragraph 3 which means healthy and strong?3.Which character in the story can you relate the most and why?4.Why do filipinos compare themselves to a bamboo tree?5.What are the 2 words in the last paragraph which means kindness and generosity?SALAMAT NAPO AGAD​</a>

                                            Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

Lobar or Sublobar Resection for Peripheral Stage IA Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The increased detection of small-sized peripheral non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has 
renewed interest in sublobar resection in lieu of lobectomy. We conducted a multicenter, 
noninferiority, phase 3 trial in which patients with NSCLC clinically staged as T1aN0 (tumor size, 
≤2 cm) were randomly assigned to undergo sublobar resection or lobar resection after 
intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as the time between randomization 
and disease recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, 
locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. From June 2007 through March 2017, a total of 697 patients were assigned to undergo sublobar resection (340 patients) 
or lobar resection (357 patients). After a median follow-up of 7 years, sublobar resection was 
non-inferior to lobar resection for disease-free survival (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or 
death, 1.01; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.24). In addition, overall survival after 
sublobar resection was similar to that after lobar resection (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.72 to 1.26).
The 5-year disease-free survival was 63.6% (95% CI, 57.9 to 68.8) after sublobar resection and 
64.1% (95% CI, 58.5 to 69.0) after lobar resection. The 5-year overall survival was 80.3% (95% 
CI, 75.5 to 84.3) after sublobar resection and 78.9% (95% CI, 74.1 to 82.9) after lobar resection. 
No substantial difference was seen between the two groups in the incidence of locoregional or 
distant recurrence. At 6 months postoperatively, a between-group difference of 2 percentage 
points was measured in the median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, favoring the sublobar-resection group.</a>

Adolescence is a time of trouble and emotional turbulence for most teenagers. 	2.		The average age of onset of puberty today varies from nation to nation and from ethnic group to ethnic group. 	3.		Physical growth in puberty proceeds from the extremities of the body to the core. 	4.	During the growth spurt, females typically gain almost 40 pounds.           5. Late-maturing girls and early-maturing boys have the most difficult time adjusting to puberty.           6. (In person) Adolescents' attitudes towards menstruation and first ejaculation have changed in recent years, and most young people no longer face these events with anxiety, embarrassment, or guilt.           7. (research report) Most adolescents are satisfied with their physical appearance.           8. The typical adolescent needs about 50 % more calcium, iron, and zinc during the growth spurt than during earlier periods.           9.   In most cases of sexual abuse, overt force is used. 	10.		The early use of drugs such as marijuana makes later drug abuse and addiction more likely, but this outcome is not inevitable. 	11. Unlike younger children, adolescents typically are not egocentric in their thought patterns. 	12. Adolescents are able to speculate, hypothesize, and fantasize much more readily than children, who are still tied to concrete operational thinking. 	13.		Adolescents often create imaginary audience as they mentally picture how others will react to their behavior and physical appearance. 	14. During adolescents, peers have a stronger influence than parents do on a young person's development. 	15.		Thinking about committing suicide is actually quite rare among high school students.LPplease answer​</a>

Lobar or Sublobar Resection for Peripheral Stage IA Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The increased detection of small-sized peripheral non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has renewed interest in sublobar resection in lieu of lobectomy. We conducted a multicenter, noninferiority, phase 3 trial in which patients with NSCLC clinically staged as T1aN0 (tumor size, ≤2 cm) were randomly assigned to undergo sublobar resection or lobar resection after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as the time between randomization and disease recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. From June 2007 through March 2017, a total of 697 patients were assigned to undergo sublobar resection (340 patients) or lobar resection (357 patients). After a median follow-up of 7 years, sublobar resection was non-inferior to lobar resection for disease-free survival (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 1.01; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.24). In addition, overall survival after sublobar resection was similar to that after lobar resection (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.26).
The 5-year disease-free survival was 63.6% (95% CI, 57.9 to 68.8) after sublobar resection and 64.1% (95% CI, 58.5 to 69.0) after lobar resection. The 5-year overall survival was 80.3% (95% CI, 75.5 to 84.3) after sublobar resection and 78.9% (95% CI, 74.1 to 82.9) after lobar resection. No substantial difference was seen between the two groups in the incidence of locoregional or distant recurrence. At 6 months postoperatively, a between-group difference of 2 percentage points was measured in the median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, favoring the sublobar-resection group.</a>

                            12. PA TULONG PO SALAMAT POSANA DI KAYO BUMAGSAK1;There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.2;The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.3;The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace .4;The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.5;And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture. 6;The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.7;Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.Questions:1.What was the argument of the bamboo and the Mango tree?2.What word in paragraph 3 which means healthy and strong?3.Which character in the story can you relate the most and why?4.Why do filipinos compare themselves to a bamboo tree?5.What are the 2 words in the last paragraph which means kindness and generosity?SALAMAT NAPO AGAD​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. They were arguing over which of them were stronger.</p><p>2. Robust</p><p>3. The bamboo, beacause I usually just sit back and humbly let people have their way.</p><p>4. Because it symbolizes being graceful and humble.</p><p>5. Benevolence and magnanimity</p><br />

                            17. Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

Lobar or Sublobar Resection for Peripheral Stage IA Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The increased detection of small-sized peripheral non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has 
renewed interest in sublobar resection in lieu of lobectomy. We conducted a multicenter, 
noninferiority, phase 3 trial in which patients with NSCLC clinically staged as T1aN0 (tumor size, 
≤2 cm) were randomly assigned to undergo sublobar resection or lobar resection after 
intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as the time between randomization 
and disease recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, 
locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. From June 2007 through March 2017, a total of 697 patients were assigned to undergo sublobar resection (340 patients) 
or lobar resection (357 patients). After a median follow-up of 7 years, sublobar resection was 
non-inferior to lobar resection for disease-free survival (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or 
death, 1.01; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.24). In addition, overall survival after 
sublobar resection was similar to that after lobar resection (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.72 to 1.26).
The 5-year disease-free survival was 63.6% (95% CI, 57.9 to 68.8) after sublobar resection and 
64.1% (95% CI, 58.5 to 69.0) after lobar resection. The 5-year overall survival was 80.3% (95% 
CI, 75.5 to 84.3) after sublobar resection and 78.9% (95% CI, 74.1 to 82.9) after lobar resection. 
No substantial difference was seen between the two groups in the incidence of locoregional or 
distant recurrence. At 6 months postoperatively, a between-group difference of 2 percentage 
points was measured in the median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, favoring the sublobar-resection group.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The article discusses the results of a phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of sublobar resection and lobar resection for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who are clinically staged as T1aN0. The main objective of the study was to determine if sublobar resection is a feasible alternative to lobar resection, which is a more invasive surgery. The study found that sublobar resection was comparable to lobar resection in terms of disease-free survival, and overall survival after sublobar resection was similar to that after lobar resection.</p><p></p><p>The title of the article, "Lobar or Sublobar Resection for Peripheral Stage IA Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer," provides a clear indication of the topic being discussed. The opening sentence also highlights the increasing incidence of small-sized peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer and the need to explore sublobar resection as a potential alternative. The article further states that the study was a multicenter, noninferiority, phase 3 trial that randomly assigned patients with T1aN0 lung cancer to either sublobar resection or lobar resection after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.</p><p></p><p>The article goes on to provide details on the primary endpoint of the trial, which was disease-free survival, as well as the secondary endpoints, such as overall survival, locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. The study involved 697 patients, with 340 patients assigned to sublobar resection and 357 patients assigned to lobar resection. After a median follow-up of seven years, the results indicated that sublobar resection was non-inferior to lobar resection in terms of disease-free survival. Furthermore, the study found that overall survival after sublobar resection was comparable to that after lobar resection.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the article summarized the findings of the study, indicating that the 5-year disease-free survival rate was similar for both groups. Additionally, the article highlights that there was no substantial difference in the incidence of locoregional or distant recurrence between the two groups. The study found that at six months postoperatively, the median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in one second was slightly higher in the sublobar-resection group. Overall, the study suggests that sublobar resection may be a feasible alternative to lobar resection for patients with T1aN0 non-small-cell lung cancer.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The main idea of the text is that sublobar resection is a feasible alternative to lobectomy for patients with small-sized peripheral non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that are clinically staged as T1aN0 (tumor size, ≤2 cm). The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sublobar resection versus lobar resection for disease-free survival, overall survival, locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. The study was a multicenter, noninferiority, phase 3 trial that randomly assigned 697 patients to undergo sublobar resection or lobar resection after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.</p><p></p><p>The text presents various details that help determine the main idea. First, the introduction notes that there is renewed interest in sublobar resection for small-sized peripheral non-small cell lung cancer, implying that there is a need for a feasible alternative to lobectomy. The text then mentions the specifics of the study, such as the multicenter, noninferiority, phase 3 trial, and the random assignment of patients to either sublobar or lobar resection after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.</p><p></p><p>The primary endpoint, disease-free survival, is also highlighted, and the text presents the results of the study. The hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death was 1.01, indicating that sublobar resection was non-inferior to lobar resection for disease-free survival. Additionally, the study found that overall survival after sublobar resection was similar to that after lobar resection. The text presents the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates for both sublobar and lobar resection, providing evidence for the main idea.</p><p></p><p>The study also looked at secondary endpoints, including locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. The text notes that there was no substantial difference in the incidence of locoregional or distant recurrence between the two groups. The study found that there was a slight difference in the median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, favoring the sublobar-resection group, but this difference was not substantial.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the text provides various details, including the study design, the primary and secondary endpoints, and the results of the study, to support the main idea that sublobar resection is a feasible alternative to lobectomy for patients with small-sized peripheral non-small cell lung cancer that are clinically staged as T1aN0.</p><br />

The early use of drugs such as marijuana makes later drug abuse and addiction more likely, but this outcome is not inevitable. 	11. Unlike younger children, adolescents typically are not egocentric in their thought patterns. 	12. Adolescents are able to speculate, hypothesize, and fantasize much more readily than children, who are still tied to concrete operational thinking. 	13.		Adolescents often create imaginary audience as they mentally picture how others will react to their behavior and physical appearance. 	14.

Lobar or Sublobar Resection for Peripheral Stage IA Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The increased detection of small-sized peripheral non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has renewed interest in sublobar resection in lieu of lobectomy. We conducted a multicenter, noninferiority, phase 3 trial in which patients with NSCLC clinically staged as T1aN0 (tumor size, ≤2 cm) were randomly assigned to undergo sublobar resection or lobar resection after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease.
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as the time between randomization and disease recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, locoregional and systemic recurrence, and pulmonary functions. From June 2007 through March 2017, a total of 697 patients were assigned to undergo sublobar resection (340 patients) or lobar resection (357 patients). After a median follow-up of 7 years, sublobar resection was non-inferior to lobar resection for disease-free survival (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 1.01; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.24). In addition, overall survival after sublobar resection was similar to that after lobar resection (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.26).
The 5-year disease-free survival was 63.6% (95% CI, 57.9 to 68.8) after sublobar resection and 64.1% (95% CI, 58.5 to 69.0) after lobar resection. The 5-year overall survival was 80.3% (95% CI, 75.5 to 84.3) after sublobar resection and 78.9% (95% CI, 74.1 to 82.9) after lobar resection. No substantial difference was seen between the two groups in the incidence of locoregional or distant recurrence. At 6 months postoperatively, a between-group difference of 2 percentage points was measured in the median percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, favoring the sublobar-resection group.</h2><br />
