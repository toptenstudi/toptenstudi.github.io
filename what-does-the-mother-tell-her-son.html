                                            Poem Mother to Son By Langston Hughes Well, son, I'll tell you: Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it. And splinters, And boards torn up, And places with no carpet on the floor- Bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, And reachin' landin's. And turnin' corners, And sometimes goin' in the dark Where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard. Don't you fall now For I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin', And life for me ain't been no crystal stair. Guide Questions: 1. Who is the persona in the poem? 2. How does the speaker describe her life in the first seven lines? 3. What would it be like to climb a strange staircase "in the dark"? 4. What does the speaker tell the boy?​</a>

And splinters, And boards torn up, And places with no carpet on the floor- Bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, And reachin' landin's. And turnin' corners, And sometimes goin' in the dark Where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard. Don't you fall now For I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin', And life for me ain't been no crystal stair. Guide Questions: 1. Who is the persona in the poem? 2.
