Deductive reasoning uses a set of specific observations to reach an overarching conclusion or it is the process of recognizing or observing patterns and drawing a conclusion. 2. The conclusion formed by using inductive reasoning is often called a conjecture. 3. Inductive reasoning is the process of reaching conclusion by applying general assumptions, procedure or principle or it is a process of reasoning logically from given statement to a conclusion. 4. Conjecture is a form of deductive reasoning where you arrive at a specific conclusion by examining two other premises or ideas. 5. In deductive reasoning, the two premises are the major and the minor premises and these are called an argument also known as syllogism. 6. A categorical syllogisms follow the statement that "If A is part of C, then B is part of C". 7. Intuition is an immediate understanding or knowing something without reasoning. 8. A certainty is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement while proofs are an example of mathematical logical proof. 9. An indirect proof is also known as contrapositive proof. 10.

                            5. Lesson 2: Providing Evidence to Support Opinions Read the lecture below. An opinion refers to a personal belief. It is a statement of what a person or an author thinks or believes. It also relates to how someone feels about something. Others may agree or disagree with your opinion; however, you must back it up with evidence and other supporting details to persuade your target audience and/or listeners. What is evidence? Evidence is anything that tends to prove or disprove something. It is mostly thought of as proof to come to a belief, conclusion, or judgment about a topic. This may include examples, images, personal experiences, diagrams, charts and graphs, surveys, experiments, and other secondary sources of information. Providing evidence to support opinions requires the audience to use their previous knowledge and think more deeply about it. The following sentence patterns will help you in citing evidence to support opinions. This will also guide you to relate and get answers to the essential questions below. 1. What led you to that idea? 2. How does the evidence support your idea? Here are some statements that you can use in providing evidences. .

It will help you decide what counts as evidence, put evidence to work in your writing, and determine whether you have enough evidence. It will also offer links to additional resources.Many papers that you write in college will require you to make an argument; this means that you must take a position on the subject you are discussing and support that position with evidence. It’s important that you use the right kind of evidence, that you use it effectively, and that you have an appropriate amount of it. If, for example, your philosophy professor didn’t like it that you used a survey of public opinion as your primary evidence in your ethics paper, you need to find out more about what philosophers count as good evidence. If your instructor has told you that you need more analysis, suggested that you’re “just listing” points or giving a “laundry list,” or asked you how certain points are related to your argument, it may mean that you can do more to fully incorporate your evidence into your argument. Comments like “for example?,” “proof?,” “go deeper,” orexpand” in the margins of your graded paper suggest that you may need more evidence. Let’s take a look at each of these issues—understanding what counts as evidence, using evidence in your argument, and deciding whether you need more evidence.WHAT </p><p></p><p>COUNTS AS EVIDENCE?</p><p>Before you begin gathering information for possible use as evidence in your argument, you need to be sure that you understand the purpose of your assignment. If you are working on a project for a class, look carefully at the assignment prompt. It may give you clues about what sorts of evidence you will need. Does the instructor mention any particular books you should use in writing your paper or the names of any authors who have written about your topic? How long should your paper be (longer works may require more, or more varied, evidence)? What themes or topics come up in the text of the prompt? Our handout on understanding writing assignments can help you interpret your assignment. It’s also a good idea to think over what has been said about the assignment in class and to talk with your instructor if you need clarification or guidance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>WHAT MATTERS TO INSTRUCTORS?</p><p>Instructors in different academic fields expect different kinds of arguments and evidence—your chemistry paper might include graphs, charts, statistics, and other quantitative data as evidence, whereas your English paper might include passages from a novel, examples of recurring symbols, or discussions of characterization in the novel. Consider what kinds of sources and evidence you have seen in course readings and lectures. You may wish to see whether the Writing Center has a handout regarding the specific academic field you’re working in—for example, literature, sociology, or history.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>WHAT ARE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES?</p><p>A note on terminology: many researchers distinguish between primary and secondary sources of evidence (in this case, “primary” means “first” or “original,” not “most important”). Primary sources include original documents, photographs, interviews, and so forth. Secondary sources present information that has already been processed or interpreted by someone else. For example, if you are writing a paper about the movie “The Matrix,” the movie itself, an interview with the director, and production photos could serve as primary sources of evidence. A movie review from a magazine or a collection of essays about the film would be secondary sources. Depending on the context, the same item could be either a primary or a secondary source: if I am writing about people’s relationships with animals, a collection of stories about animals might be a secondary source; if I am writing about </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> true answer po</p><p></p><p>hope its helps</p><br />

                            14. A. TRUE or FALSE Directions: Read the following statement carefully. Write T if the statement is true, otherwise write F on the space provided before each item. 1. Deductive reasoning uses a set of specific observations to reach an overarching conclusion or it is the process of recognizing or observing patterns and drawing a conclusion. 2. The conclusion formed by using inductive reasoning is often called a conjecture. 3. Inductive reasoning is the process of reaching conclusion by applying general assumptions, procedure or principle or it is a process of reasoning logically from given statement to a conclusion. 4. Conjecture is a form of deductive reasoning where you arrive at a specific conclusion by examining two other premises or ideas. 5. In deductive reasoning, the two premises are the major and the minor premises and these are called an argument also known as syllogism. 6. A categorical syllogisms follow the statement that "If A is part of C, then B is part of C". 7. Intuition is an immediate understanding or knowing something without reasoning. 8. A certainty is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement while proofs are an example of mathematical logical proof. 9. An indirect proof is also known as contrapositive proof. 10. Greg Polya is known as the "Father of Problem Solving".​</h2><br />
