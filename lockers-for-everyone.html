                                            Activity 3: Analyze and evaluate the persuasive essay below by following the given instructions. Lockers for Everyone What would you think if you had to put your personal belongings in a crate, and every time you tum around something of yours were stolen? That is why I think students should have lockers. To protect their things, keep their things somewhere clean, and so they won't have to complain about carrying everything at once. Students should have lockers because it will stop people from stealing their stuff. For example, the children will not have to worry about their books, homework assignments, and personal belongings being stolen. The reason for this is that the children will have their own lockers plus their own locks, which only they have the combination to. This will reduce cases where things are being stolen. Students also should have lockers so they will have a clean place to put their books. What I mean by this is that many desks are rusty and have gum stuck under them. Also, if you put you stuff into a crate then it is easily collecting dust. This connects to my argument because their stuff will be kept very clean in a neat environment if students are given lockers to use My final reason why I think students should have lockers is so students won't complain about caring everything at once. The things that they may be caring everyday are very heavy. This is important because students may suffer health problems from having to carry all their stuff everywhere. Why carry books everyday why you can eliminate the pain by having a locker to store the things you don't need? Also, they're always whining about having to carry all their books. If we had lockers everyone would be happier. In conclusion I think students should have lockers. If we have lockers stealing in school would go down, it would create a safe and clean place for students to put their things, and students would complain less and be healthier. If we had lockers, the school would be a happier place for everyone. If you don't want your things stolen, contact your principal and demand lockers for your school. Instructions: 1.

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="my-math-book-is-in-my-locker-all-the-digits-in-my-locker-are-odd-numbers-and-their-sum-is-11-there-are-120-lockers-what-is-my-locker-number">
                            7. My math book is in my locker.All the digits in my locker are odd numbers and their sum is 11 there are 120 lockers. What is my locker number?</h2><br />
                        Since there are 120 lockers that would mean that the locker number has 3 digits (including 0 as the first digit). Since all the digits are odd numbers we let the first digit be 2a - 1, the second be 2b - 1 and the third be 2c - 1.<br /><br />(2a - 1) + (2b - 1) + (2c - 1) = 11<br />2(a+b+c) - 3 = 11<br />2(a+b+c) = 14<br />a + b + c = 7<br /><br />We need to take note that the first digit can only be 0 or 1. Since all digits are odd a is 1.<br /><br />1 + b + c = 7<br />b + c = 6<br /><br />The possible pairs are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), and  (5,1). Since all digits are odd we only take the pairs (1.5), (3,3) and (5,1). The only possible locker numbers are from 100 to 120 since our first digit is 1. So we can only take the pair (1,5). <br /><br />Therefore the locker number is 115. <br /><br />

                            18. Activity 3: Analyze and evaluate the persuasive essay below by following the given instructions. Lockers for Everyone What would you think if you had to put your personal belongings in a crate, and every time you tum around something of yours were stolen? That is why I think students should have lockers. To protect their things, keep their things somewhere clean, and so they won't have to complain about carrying everything at once. Students should have lockers because it will stop people from stealing their stuff. For example, the children will not have to worry about their books, homework assignments, and personal belongings being stolen. The reason for this is that the children will have their own lockers plus their own locks, which only they have the combination to. This will reduce cases where things are being stolen. Students also should have lockers so they will have a clean place to put their books. What I mean by this is that many desks are rusty and have gum stuck under them. Also, if you put you stuff into a crate then it is easily collecting dust. This connects to my argument because their stuff will be kept very clean in a neat environment if students are given lockers to use My final reason why I think students should have lockers is so students won't complain about caring everything at once. The things that they may be caring everyday are very heavy. This is important because students may suffer health problems from having to carry all their stuff everywhere. Why carry books everyday why you can eliminate the pain by having a locker to store the things you don't need? Also, they're always whining about having to carry all their books. If we had lockers everyone would be happier. In conclusion I think students should have lockers. If we have lockers stealing in school would go down, it would create a safe and clean place for students to put their things, and students would complain less and be healthier. If we had lockers, the school would be a happier place for everyone. If you don't want your things stolen, contact your principal and demand lockers for your school. Instructions: 1.

                        <p></p><p>answer:</p><p></p><p>Using Polya's four steps in problem solving, we can solve this problem as follows:</p><p></p><p>Understand the problem: In this problem, there are 1,000 lockers in a high school and 1,000 students. Each student takes a turn, starting with the first student who opens all 1,000 lockers, and the second student closes every other locker, and so on. The question is asking how many lockers will be open at the end.</p><p></p><p>Devise a plan: We can solve this problem by determining the factors of each locker number and seeing if the number of factors is even or odd. If the number of factors is even, the locker will be closed at the end. If the number of factors is odd, the locker will be open at the end.</p><p></p><p>Carry out the plan: After determining the factors of each locker number, we can see which lockers have an odd number of factors and which have an even number of factors. Only locker numbers that are perfect squares will have an odd number of factors. So, we can find out how many perfect squares are there between 1 and 1000.</p><p></p><p>Look back: Since the lockers are numbered from 1 to 1000, there are 31 perfect squares between 1 and 1000. Therefore, 31 lockers will be open at the end.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>the number of possible locker combinations is 729.<p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Depending on whether leaving “0” out was a mistake, you have either 729 or 1,000 possible combinations.</p><p></p><p>many mechanical combination locks had a lot of slop; if you got within 2 numbers of the right number it would “pick up” the next cam. Although the locks seemed to have 1,000,000 combinations, you actually only needed to try 20^3 (8000) numbers. Worse yet, once you’ve picked up the first two numbers, you can just put torque on the handle and slowly turn the dial. So you really only needed to try 400 positions. You could open those locks in a few minutes if you knew what you were doing.</p><p></p><br />
