He lay down beneath a tree on which hung a huge beehive,closed one eye, and rested. Soon a prince called Sumusong-sa-Alongancame by, riding on a horse. On his saddle hung many bags of gold and► other beautiful things that he had won on hisconquests. He askedPilandok what he was doing under the tree. Without opening his eye,Pilandok answered that he was the servant of a powerful sultan and thathe was guarding a royal gong whom no ordinary man may beat. And thenhe pointed up at where the beehive hung. "Let me beat the gong,Pilandok," Sumusong-sa-Alongan said. "No, the sultan will be angry withme if I let just any man beat the royal gong," Pilandok said firmly."I amnot an ordinary man. I am the son of a sultan myself. Here – I will give youa whole bag of gold if you will only let me beat the gong." Pilandokpretended to think. And after a while, he said "I'll take that bag. But please,beat the gong only when I am far away, for the sultan might come at thesound of it and chop off my head." Pilandok swept up the bag of gold andran away as fast as he could. When Sumusong-sa-Alongan could nolonger see him, the prince took a big stick from the ground and beat thebeehive. Hundreds of angry bees were upon him in an instant, and if atroop of soldiers had not come his way and helped him, he would havedied.

                                            The Crow and the SparrowOnce upon a time a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day when they were Hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers,” said the crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see who can eat the Most.” “All right!” answered the sparrow. “Then the one who wins will eat the other,” said the crow. The sparrow laughed and agreed for he thought the crow was joking. Friends do Not eat each other. The sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated. For each Pepper that he ate, he hid three more under the mat without the sparrow’s seeing.“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” said the crow. Then at last the sparrow realized that the crow was serious. “All right,” he said, “I’ll keep my promise. But before you eat me you must wash Your beak for everyone knows that you’re a dirty bird and eat lots of nasty things.” So the crow went to the river and cried. “River! River!Give me water To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The river replied: “You want water? Very well, but everyone says you eat nasty Things. If you want to wash your beak in my water, you must get a pot to put it in and then You can have as much water as you like.”The crow went to the potter in the village and cried: “Potter! Potter! Make me a pot To fetch some water. To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The potter replied: “You want a pot? Very well, but I have no clay. Bring me some clay and “I’ll make you a pot.”The crow went to a field and began digging up clay with his beak. The earth said: “The whole world knows that you eat rubbish and nasty things. I cannot allow you to dig Up my clay unless you use a spade.”The crow went to the village blacksmith, who was working on a wheel. The crow Said to him: “Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Make me a spadeTo dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak,To make myself neat,The sparrow to eat!” The blacksmith replied: “You want a spade? Very well, but you see I have no fire In the forge. If you want me to make a spade, you must bring me some fire.”The crow went to a farmer’s house nearby. The farmer’s wife was cooking rice in The courtyard. The crow cried:“Dear farmer’s wife! Give me fire To make a spade To dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The farmer’s wife replied: “You want fire? Very well, but how will you carry it?” “You can put it on my back,” said the crow.The farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and immediately his feathers burst Into flames. The greedy crow was burnt to ashes. But the honest sparrow lived to a ripe Old age.​</a>

Read the "Parable of theroa"Parable of the Prodigal Son"The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of theestate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his Inheritance, he wanted it immediately. Thefather agrees and divides his estate between both sons.Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money inextravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a famine strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take workas a swineherd. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.)When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses. And when he cameto himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I willarise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no moreworthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he wasyet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. This implies thefather was hopefully watching for the son's return. The son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech, before hisfather accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitation as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, aring, and sandals, and slaughter the "fatted calf" for a celebratory meal. The older son, who was at work in the fields, hearsthe sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. Healso has a speech for his father. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neithertransgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. Thefather explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary. It wasmeet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.​</a>

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

The Forgiving Crocodile
By Deshery F. Gabatano
Long time ago near the river bank of Madiangat River, Solano Nueva Vizcaya there lived a family the mother and her two little babies the mother was always busy hunting food for her family whenever she was out of their of their home, she was always worried about her two little babies because nobody was taking care of them one day while she was at the forest near the river busy hunting for food she found an old lady who was pale and sickly picking up fruits to eat. She was about to swallow her but the old lady asked Pitifully from Buwahaya and promise to do anything for Buwahaya in return buwaya for her then she remembered her two little babies who need somebody to take care of them when she's out so buwaya brought with her Aling Sita the old lady the crocodile ask aling sita to take care of her two little babies and in return she will take care of her and bring her delicious food to eat everyday aling sita sings that song to the two little baby crocodiles and hit them when they won't sleep when mother crocodile comes home she always bring delicious food and nutritious food for Aling Sita the old lady was so happy and promise to keep an eye for her baby crocodiles and never mistreat the two but in contrast as soon as Buwahaya leaves their home the old lady sit's all day without looking after the two baby crocodiles when it's about time for Buwahaya to arrive Aling Sita gets up.She hurriedly feeds and bathes them and cleans up the mess as soon as mother crocodile arrives she check her children
if they are clean,well fed and have enough sleep. Aling Sita always says well your children are well taking good care I work all day to feed them clean them up and let them sleep buwahaya was very grateful to aling sita with a good deed showing to her children as a sign of gratitude mother crocodile daily brings her delicious food to eat. One day Buwahaya was so curious on how the old lady takes good care of her two little babies she secretly hid behind and observed what the old lady does when she was out as usual Aling Sita sits all day and b the babies when they don't sleep when the babies are about to sleep she isang them a lullaby la la la sleep now ugly crocodiles you are both awful your smell is so unpleasant I hate crocodiles like you la la la hearing Aling Sita song Buwahaya grew in anger she went away and found food for her babies she also gathered food for Aling Sita but instead of delicious food buaya collected all the snakes near the river and place them in the basket for Aling Sita as soon as Buwahaya arrived home she handed the basket to Aling Sita this is for you i got the best food for you today i'm good you always doing for my babies thank you so much Aling Sita answered happily. Aling Sita opened the basket eagerly. Upon opening she was shocked coming out from the basket. that's your price of being rude to my baby's I was so kind to you but you treated my baby's foolishly said Buwahaya angrily please forgive me Buwahaya a handful for the past day for give my foolishness pleaded Aling Sita I promise that i will never do the same again i did the frightened old lady though seemed expected, Buwahaya had forgiven Aling Sita.

                                            The Two BrothersEgyptian Folktale1Once, there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother to live with him and treated him like a son. When the lil' bro grew into a young man, he was an excellent worker. He did the plowing and harvested the corn; there was not an equal in the land. Behold the spirit of a god was with him.2Every morning, the younger bro followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields and every evening he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother and at dawn, he took the bread with him which he had baked and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with him his bread and drove the cattle into the field.3Because Anpu loved his brother very much, his wife became jealous and wanted to destroy Bata. One day when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said, "Get up and give me some corn so that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay."4At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which she had painted black and blue, and accused Bata of having beaten her. She pretended to be in great pain. She didn't give him water to wash his hands with, she didn't light the fire for him, she pretended that she was very sick. And Anpu became very angry; he sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable.5When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual loaded with herbs, milk, and wood. And as he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang at him and Bata fled praying to Ra, "My good lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good." And Ra heard his cry; he made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles. And Bata said to his elder brother, "Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father?6And has not your wife been as a mother to me? Now, since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia." Anpu answered, "Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her?" Bata answered, "I did no such thing. Have I not told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?" So Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then he sat down, poured ashes on his head, and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of the Acacia. There was no one with him; he slew wild beasts for food and built himself a house under the acacia tree, which is sacred to the gods.7One day as he walked out of his house, he met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, "Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone. And Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess and Bata loved her very much.What lesson did you learn from the story?​</a>

He lay down beneath a tree on which hung a huge beehive,closed one eye, and rested. Soon a prince called Sumusong-sa-Alongancame by, riding on a horse. On his saddle hung many bags of gold and► other beautiful things that he had won on hisconquests. He askedPilandok what he was doing under the tree. Without opening his eye,Pilandok answered that he was the servant of a powerful sultan and thathe was guarding a royal gong whom no ordinary man may beat. And thenhe pointed up at where the beehive hung. "Let me beat the gong,Pilandok," Sumusong-sa-Alongan said. "No, the sultan will be angry withme if I let just any man beat the royal gong," Pilandok said firmly."I amnot an ordinary man. I am the son of a sultan myself. Here – I will give youa whole bag of gold if you will only let me beat the gong." Pilandokpretended to think. And after a while, he said "I'll take that bag. But please,beat the gong only when I am far away, for the sultan might come at thesound of it and chop off my head." Pilandok swept up the bag of gold andran away as fast as he could. When Sumusong-sa-Alongan could nolonger see him, the prince took a big stick from the ground and beat thebeehive. Hundreds of angry bees were upon him in an instant, and if atroop of soldiers had not come his way and helped him, he would havedied.

                            19. The Crow and the SparrowOnce upon a time a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day when they were Hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers,” said the crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see who can eat the Most.” “All right!” answered the sparrow. “Then the one who wins will eat the other,” said the crow. The sparrow laughed and agreed for he thought the crow was joking. Friends do Not eat each other. The sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated. For each Pepper that he ate, he hid three more under the mat without the sparrow’s seeing.“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” said the crow. Then at last the sparrow realized that the crow was serious. “All right,” he said, “I’ll keep my promise. But before you eat me you must wash Your beak for everyone knows that you’re a dirty bird and eat lots of nasty things.” So the crow went to the river and cried. “River! River!Give me water To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The river replied: “You want water? Very well, but everyone says you eat nasty Things. If you want to wash your beak in my water, you must get a pot to put it in and then You can have as much water as you like.”The crow went to the potter in the village and cried: “Potter! Potter! Make me a pot To fetch some water. To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The potter replied: “You want a pot? Very well, but I have no clay. Bring me some clay and “I’ll make you a pot.”The crow went to a field and began digging up clay with his beak. The earth said: “The whole world knows that you eat rubbish and nasty things. I cannot allow you to dig Up my clay unless you use a spade.”The crow went to the village blacksmith, who was working on a wheel. The crow Said to him: “Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Make me a spadeTo dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak,To make myself neat,The sparrow to eat!” The blacksmith replied: “You want a spade? Very well, but you see I have no fire In the forge. If you want me to make a spade, you must bring me some fire.”The crow went to a farmer’s house nearby. The farmer’s wife was cooking rice in The courtyard. The crow cried:“Dear farmer’s wife! Give me fire To make a spade To dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The farmer’s wife replied: “You want fire? Very well, but how will you carry it?” “You can put it on my back,” said the crow.The farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and immediately his feathers burst Into flames. The greedy crow was burnt to ashes. But the honest sparrow lived to a ripe Old age.​</h2><br />

                            20. V. Read the "Parable of theroa"Parable of the Prodigal Son"The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of theestate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his Inheritance, he wanted it immediately. Thefather agrees and divides his estate between both sons.Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money inextravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a famine strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take workas a swineherd. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.)When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses. And when he cameto himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I willarise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no moreworthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he wasyet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. This implies thefather was hopefully watching for the son's return. The son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech, before hisfather accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitation as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, aring, and sandals, and slaughter the "fatted calf" for a celebratory meal. The older son, who was at work in the fields, hearsthe sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. Healso has a speech for his father. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neithertransgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. Thefather explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary. It wasmeet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.​</h2><br />

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

                            29. The Two BrothersEgyptian Folktale1Once, there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother to live with him and treated him like a son. When the lil' bro grew into a young man, he was an excellent worker. He did the plowing and harvested the corn; there was not an equal in the land. Behold the spirit of a god was with him.2Every morning, the younger bro followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields and every evening he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother and at dawn, he took the bread with him which he had baked and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with him his bread and drove the cattle into the field.3Because Anpu loved his brother very much, his wife became jealous and wanted to destroy Bata. One day when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said, "Get up and give me some corn so that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay."4At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which she had painted black and blue, and accused Bata of having beaten her. She pretended to be in great pain. She didn't give him water to wash his hands with, she didn't light the fire for him, she pretended that she was very sick. And Anpu became very angry; he sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable.5When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual loaded with herbs, milk, and wood. And as he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang at him and Bata fled praying to Ra, "My good lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good." And Ra heard his cry; he made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles. And Bata said to his elder brother, "Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father?6And has not your wife been as a mother to me? Now, since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia." Anpu answered, "Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her?" Bata answered, "I did no such thing. Have I not told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?" So Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then he sat down, poured ashes on his head, and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of the Acacia. There was no one with him; he slew wild beasts for food and built himself a house under the acacia tree, which is sacred to the gods.7One day as he walked out of his house, he met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, "Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone. And Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess and Bata loved her very much.What lesson did you learn from the story?​</h2><br />
