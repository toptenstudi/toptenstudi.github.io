June 29, 2016
Today, in Science, we made a little bug zoo. We went for a nature walk, and I
found a beetle while Joel found a cicada. Anna ran back to the classroom and got a
note card and a clean jar. I put the jar over the beetle and slipped the note card under
it. Joel added his cicada and we got some damp grass and put it in the jar. For the
top, we fastened a piece of screen with a rubber band. Right after putting the insects in
the jar, we had fun watching and listening to our bugs. Tomorrow, we will put them
back outside. I’m planning to make a bug zoo of my own.

PASSAGE:
Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
 By Sara Goudarzi
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.      
Question:
Which statement best describes the author’s attitude toward teenagers? 
Select one:
a. Teens don’t think things out clearly and therefore they are unable to make logical decisions.
b. Teens are careless about other’s feelings.
c. Teens should be given a break because it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes
d. Teens today are lazy and have little respect for their elders.</a>

read. You may have told about the characters. You may have told about the setting.
You probably told about how a problem was solved. But did you know that
summarizing is not just for stories? You can use your summarizing skills to be better
prepared in all your subjects.
Some students have a hard time with science and social studies because there
are lots of new words There is also a lot of information to remember. Research shows
that just writing things down will help you remember them. It works even if you never
read what you wrote again. Wow! That’s a great reason for taking notes.
Did you know that taking notes is summarizing? When you read your science and
social studies textbooks, keep a notebook with lined paper close to you. Most
textbooks are divided into sections that have headings. Headings are like titles in
darker letters. Write down the headings of each section before you read the selection.
As you read, jot down the big ideas. Look for the new words. You can also use your
summary to study!
Answer the following questions based on the reading passage.
1.Why are science and social studies hard for some people?
2. What does research say about writing things down?
3.What is heading in your textbook?
4. Based on the other information in the last paragraph, what do the words jot down
mean?
5. What can you use when you study? 6. Write a summary of the given text. please answer it</a>

PASSAGE:
Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
 By Sara Goudarzi 
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
 In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.

WATCHING TOO MUCH One of the physiological effects of watching TV in excessive amounts is eyestrain. There are guidelines that one can follow in watching TV to protect one's eyes. First, the television should be 5 meters away from the eyes. Next, the room should be adequately lit. Also, the TV should be placed at the same height with our eyes. While these may be helpful, these do not prevent our eyes from getting tired if we keep watching TV for a long time.

found a beetle while Joel found a cicada. Anna ran back to the classroom and got a
note card and a clean jar. I put the jar over the beetle and slipped the note card under
it. Joel added his cicada and we got some damp grass and put it in the jar. For the
top, we fastened a piece of screen with a rubber band. Right after putting the insects in
the jar, we had fun watching and listening to our bugs. Tomorrow, we will put them
back outside. I’m planning to make a bug zoo of my own.

PASSAGE:
Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
 By Sara Goudarzi
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.      
Question:
Which statement best describes the author’s attitude toward teenagers? 
Select one:
a. Teens don’t think things out clearly and therefore they are unable to make logical decisions.
b. Teens are careless about other’s feelings.
c. Teens should be given a break because it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes
d. Teens today are lazy and have little respect for their elders.</h2><br />

You have probably written a summary after the completion of a book you have
read. You may have told about the characters. You may have told about the setting.
You probably told about how a problem was solved. But did you know that
summarizing is not just for stories? You can use your summarizing skills to be better
prepared in all your subjects.
Some students have a hard time with science and social studies because there
are lots of new words There is also a lot of information to remember. Research shows
that just writing things down will help you remember them. It works even if you never
read what you wrote again. Wow! That’s a great reason for taking notes.
Did you know that taking notes is summarizing? When you read your science and
social studies textbooks, keep a notebook with lined paper close to you. Most
textbooks are divided into sections that have headings. Headings are like titles in
darker letters. Write down the headings of each section before you read the selection.
As you read, jot down the big ideas. Look for the new words. You can also use your
summary to study!
Answer the following questions based on the reading passage.
1.Why are science and social studies hard for some people?
2. What does research say about writing things down?
3.What is heading in your textbook?

PASSAGE:
Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
 By Sara Goudarzi 
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
 In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.      
Question: 
Why did the author mention ‘hormonal shift’ in the article?

a. to make fun of the teenagers

Directions: The questions below are all factual; they can be answered by merely scanning the passage below looking for clue-words from the questions, Sixty-five million years ago the Cretaceous period ended. Many believe it ended abruptly. Sources vary widely regarding the changes that occurred, but on average they state that between 50 and 75% of all plant and animal life perished at this time. Of the animals, only amphibians and mammals survived. Fossilized dinosaur remains were first discovered in the mid-1800s. Since then, the reason for their demise has intrigued both scientists and lay- people. The most reliable testable hypothesis concerning their extinction was proposed by Alvarez and Alvarez in 1980. Walter Alvarez, a geologist, was collecting sedimentary samples near Gubbio, Italy, working as part of a team measuring iridium. Not commonly found in Earth's crust and mantle, iridium has been regularly detected in scientific samples from other parts of the solar system; in other words, the team was searching for cosmic dust. Alvarez discovered - again, sources vary a layer between 1 and 2 centimeters thick at the point believed to mark the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. This layer had an iridium content 30 times higher than its surrounding layers. 1. Who proposed the most recent testable hypothesis concerning the extinction of the dinosaurs? A. a geologist C. Popular Science Magazine B. Alvarez and Alvarez D. National Geographic Magazine. 2. What is iridium?

WATCHING TOO MUCH One of the physiological effects of watching TV in excessive amounts is eyestrain. There are guidelines that one can follow in watching TV to protect one's eyes. First, the television should be 5 meters away from the eyes. Next, the room should be adequately lit. Also, the TV should be placed at the same height with our eyes. While these may be helpful, these do not prevent our eyes from getting tired if we keep watching TV for a long time.

                            27. Directions: Read the passage and provide an answer to the question below.     PASSAGE:  Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy   By Sara Goudarzi      If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."  Teen thinking   In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"  Developing sensitivity  Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.        Question:   Why did the author mention ‘hormonal shift’ in the article?   Select one: a. to validate the claim of the research on teens’ behavior in relation to their brain development b. to persuade us to conduct research on teens’ behavior. c. to present the conclusion of the article. d. to make fun of the teenagers</h2><br />
