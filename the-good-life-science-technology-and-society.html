                                            Biology indeed offered us great adventures as we learn greatly about life! It
teaches us to know how the traits were passed from parents to offspring. Also, it
helps us to realize that we are products of a very small biomolecule which is
scientifically known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This minute biomolecule serves
as the language for genetic interpretation and we exist on what we are and what we
should look like because of the codes printed in our DNA.
Due to the advent of modern technology, our knowledge about DNA goes
beyond from what we know about it before. Scientists and field experts can now enter
and modify the codes printed in our DNA. Does it sound like magic? It’s not magic,
it’s science! They can now manipulate the traits to produce new traits and expected
traits. Science indeed did not stop surprising us.
We live in a world where some fictions from sci – fi movies could possibly
become science. An example of this is a scientific study made by some physicians,
geneticists, and embryologists from United States, Japan, and Europe. Because of
their studies about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene – altering
technologies, you can now learn, as you become a parent, your child’s sex and
discover the traits they inherited and possessed as they grow up. Also, you can now
choose your children’s traits instead of leaving those traits in nature. Because of
these studies, physicians can now routinely test embryos of different donors for
hundreds of genes and use these embryos for soon – to – be – parents and child –
bearing – want – to – be – parents to pick embryos with genes that inhibit diseases
or to pick the sex of their future progeny.
So far so good, right? But behind these good benefits, the controversy is
swirling around gene – altering techniques that poses ethical and social dilemmas
that more and more people are now facing. And for all the issues surrounding gene
editing techniques, these scientific developments of modifying humankind should
prompt us to realize that science is no longer a thing that we know in the past or a
fictional stuff of the future. It is a reality that we must all now face.
In your point of view as a senior high school STEM student, should gene
editing be performed on human embryos? Is micromanipulation of gametes and
embryos helpful or can make a permanent change to society? Explain your answer
using the concepts that you have learned from this module.</a>

Title: Environment
 The environment is the surrounding in which we live. It is the source of life. Our whole life is dependent on the environment. It directs our life and determines our proper growth and development. Good or bad quality of social life depends on the quality of our natural environment. The need for human beings for food, water, shelter, and other things depends on the environment around us. There is a balanced natural cycle exists between the environment and the lives of human beings, plants, and animals. Human society is playing a vital role in degenerating the natural environment which in turn negatively affects the lives on this planet. All the human actions in this modern world directly impact the whole ecosystem.
Even though science and technology have radically altered the terms of adaptation to nature, we still need to adapt to the environment. Human society is embedded in an environment. We must not forget that the human being is first and foremost an animal, sharing living space with other animal species in an environment on which they are mutually dependent. It is our responsibility to save our environment and earth and make the possibility of healthy and happy life here.

                            5. Biology indeed offered us great adventures as we learn greatly about life! It
teaches us to know how the traits were passed from parents to offspring. Also, it
helps us to realize that we are products of a very small biomolecule which is
scientifically known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This minute biomolecule serves
as the language for genetic interpretation and we exist on what we are and what we
should look like because of the codes printed in our DNA.
Due to the advent of modern technology, our knowledge about DNA goes
beyond from what we know about it before. Scientists and field experts can now enter
and modify the codes printed in our DNA. Does it sound like magic? It’s not magic,
it’s science! They can now manipulate the traits to produce new traits and expected
traits. Science indeed did not stop surprising us.
We live in a world where some fictions from sci – fi movies could possibly
become science. An example of this is a scientific study made by some physicians,
geneticists, and embryologists from United States, Japan, and Europe. Because of
their studies about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene – altering
technologies, you can now learn, as you become a parent, your child’s sex and
discover the traits they inherited and possessed as they grow up. Also, you can now
choose your children’s traits instead of leaving those traits in nature. Because of
these studies, physicians can now routinely test embryos of different donors for
hundreds of genes and use these embryos for soon – to – be – parents and child –
bearing – want – to – be – parents to pick embryos with genes that inhibit diseases
or to pick the sex of their future progeny.
So far so good, right? But behind these good benefits, the controversy is
swirling around gene – altering techniques that poses ethical and social dilemmas
that more and more people are now facing. And for all the issues surrounding gene
editing techniques, these scientific developments of modifying humankind should
prompt us to realize that science is no longer a thing that we know in the past or a
fictional stuff of the future. It is a reality that we must all now face.
In your point of view as a senior high school STEM student, should gene
editing be performed on human embryos? Is micromanipulation of gametes and
embryos helpful or can make a permanent change to society? Explain your answer
using the concepts that you have learned from this module.</h2><br />
                        <p>The cell is the basic unit of life. All organisms are composed of one or more cells. As will be discussed later, humans are made up of many millions of cells. In order to understand what goes wrong in cancer, it is important to understand how normal cells work. The first step is to discuss the structure and basic functions of cells.</p><p></p><p>First we will introduce the common building blocks of cells. All cells, regardless of their function or location in the body, share common features and processes. Amazingly, cells are comprised almost entirely of just four basic types of molecules. Shown above is a cell surrounded by examples of these building block molecules.</p><p></p><p>Since they are present in living things these building blocks are called biomolecules. The next sections describe the structures and functions of each of these basic building blocks. Further information on the topics on this page can also be found in most introductory Biology textbooks, we recommend Campbell Biology, 11th edition</p><p></p><br />

Title: Environment
 The environment is the surrounding in which we live. It is the source of life. Our whole life is dependent on the environment. It directs our life and determines our proper growth and development. Good or bad quality of social life depends on the quality of our natural environment. The need for human beings for food, water, shelter, and other things depends on the environment around us. There is a balanced natural cycle exists between the environment and the lives of human beings, plants, and animals. Human society is playing a vital role in degenerating the natural environment which in turn negatively affects the lives on this planet. All the human actions in this modern world directly impact the whole ecosystem.
Even though science and technology have radically altered the terms of adaptation to nature, we still need to adapt to the environment. Human society is embedded in an environment. We must not forget that the human being is first and foremost an animal, sharing living space with other animal species in an environment on which they are mutually dependent. It is our responsibility to save our environment and earth and make the possibility of healthy and happy life here.
