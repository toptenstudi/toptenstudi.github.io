                                            A researcher conducted a study in Poonbato Integrated School. With a total 
of 4,876, he cannot use all students as his participants due to lack of resources. His 
topic is about the evaluation of the school head’s Sagip Kalinga Program, a program 
focusing on indigenous peoples (IP) parents. Since the school is 100% IP school, any
parent who has a child enrolled in that school is a potential respondent. 
Questions:
1. Which type of research design is the most appropriate in this case? Read the 
topic of the research that was mentioned.
2. Which sampling technique must be used? Remember that all parents who has 
a child enrolled in that school are potential respondents.
3. What is the sample size using Slovin’s formula given a margin of error of 5%?

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI), districts are required to work with school teams to conduct a school-level needs assessment. State educational agencies (SEAs) and districts are also required to complete a needs assessment for several other major program areas included in the the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) (link is external) (e.g., Title I Part A; Title IV Part F) (for more information on these requirements, please see the the Needs Assessment Guidebook from the State Support Network, available here). Needs assessments encourage districts and their schools to systematically examine performance gaps and identify, understand, and prioritize the needs that must be addressed to improve outcomes for all students. Conducting a needs assessment can also help district and school staff understand how the various components of their local educational system interact. Specifically, the needs assessment process helps districts to:</p><p></p><p>find gaps between current conditions (what is) and desired conditions (what should be);</p><p>place these gaps or needs in priority order;</p><p>implement strategies, practices, and evidence-based interventions aligned to needs; and</p><p>target resources to address needs.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Im Mr. Brain291 that's say a good learner is top of the class.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            27. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.
