                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Fossils are a window into the past. They provide clear evidence that evolution has occurred. Scientists who find and study fossils are called paleontologists. How do they use fossils to understand the past? Consider the example of the horse, outlined in figure  9.3.2 . Fossils spanning a period of more than 50 million years show how the horse evolved.</p><p></p><p>The oldest horse fossils show what the earliest horses were like. They were only 0.4 m tall, or about the size of a fox, and they had four long toes. Other evidence shows they lived in wooded marshlands, where they probably ate soft leaves. Over time, the climate became drier, and grasslands slowly replaced the marshes. Later fossils show that horses changed as well.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest Po plssssss </p><br />

In embryonic development, STAGE 1 shows similarities as the structure of the various animals, such as cats, birds, fish, lizards and humans, appeared the same.</p><p>2.Fish embryos go through a process called mid-blastula transition which is observed around the tenth cell division in some fish species.

During this time three cell populations become distinguished.</p><p>3. a different structure like forelimbs, their sizes as well as eyes begin to appear.

                        In what stages of development of the organisms above show similarities?
<p>
</p>Best similarities appear in  stage 1 and stage 2.
<p>
</p><strong>The</strong> <strong>greatest similarity is found in the middle of embryonic development,  during the "phylotypic stage" species-specific variations predominate before and after this stage.
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p>In embryonic development, STAGE 1 shows similarities as the structure of the  various animals, such as cats, birds, fish, lizards and humans, appeared the same.
<p>
</p>In the first and second stages of development, species have typical patterns of development that display  similarity, but in stage 3 some structure that varies, such as their forelimbs, eyes, and body structure.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. phylotypic stage</p><p>2. pharyngeal slits</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The greatest similarity arises in the middle of embryonic development, during the "phylotypic stage"; species-specific differences predominate before and after this stage</p><p>2. Most of these similarities occur in the earliest stages of embryonic development. One similarity is pharyngeal slits, which develop into breathing structures, like the pharynx in humans and the gills in fish. Another is the notochord, a rod made of cartilage that supports the embryo's body.</p><p>3. An organism when viewed in an ecosystem is a community that develops together with the physical environment as a system. Organisms will always adapt to the physical environment, otherwise organisms also affect the physical environment for the purposes of life.</p><p>On the other hand, each organism may show similarities, for example certain plant or animal organisms such as the tiger will show similarities. But in a later stage two tigers will show differences even with the same sex. The difference is, for example, from the shape of the front / back legs, the size, the shape of the eyes, and even the running speed for each tiger</p><p>4.  Evidence of an evolutionary common ancestor is seen in the similarity of embryos in markedly different species. Darwin used the science of embryology to support his conclusions. Embryos and the development of embryos of various species within a class are similar even if their adult forms look nothing alike</p><p></p><br />

PLEASE PA HELP</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Q11</strong>. The stages of development that show similarities among the organisms above are Stage 1, which is the fertilization stage, and Stage 3, which is the development of the major organs and features of the organism.</p><p></p><p><strong>Q12</strong>. The structures that are similar among the organisms in Stage 3 are the formation of the major organs and features, such as the heart, liver, brain, and limbs. These structures follow a similar pattern of development among the different vertebrates, although there may be minor differences in their appearance and timing of development.</p><p></p><p><strong>Q13</strong>. In Stage 3, the structures that make the organisms different from each other are the specific details of their organ development and features. For example, the bird has wings, the cat has fur, and the human has a large brain relative to body size. These differences reflect the unique adaptations and characteristics of each species.</p><p></p><p><strong>Q14</strong>. Embryonic development can be considered as evidence for evolution because it shows that different organisms share common developmental patterns and structures, indicating a common ancestry. The similarities in embryonic development among different vertebrates suggest that they share a common ancestor and have evolved from a common ancestor over time, with each species developing unique adaptations and characteristics through the process of natural selection. This supports the theory of evolution, which states that all living organisms share a common ancestry and have evolved over time through a process of natural selection.</p><br />
