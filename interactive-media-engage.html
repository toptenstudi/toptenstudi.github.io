creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</a>

Thus, the communicative relationship reaches to the next level in which people share more information. Communication is supposed to be continuous and non-repetitive.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>In transactional model, senders and receivers both are known as communicators and both play equally important role in communication. Transactional model relates communication with social reality, cultural up-bringing and relational context (relationships).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages. In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally. ... A particular instance of communication is called a speech act.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>When communication is effective, it leaves all parties involved satisfied and feeling accomplished. By delivering messages clearly, there is no room for misunderstanding or alteration of messages, which decreases the potential for conflict.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The Interaction Model of communication (see Figure 1.4) describes communication as a process in which participants alternate positions as sender and receiver and generate meaning by sending messages and receiving feedback within physical and psychological contexts (Schramm, 1997).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Linear model of communication is a simple one way communication model. The message flows in a straight line from sender to the receiver. There is no concept of feedback. The only task that a receiver does here is to receive the message.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The Shannon–Weaver model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. ... The sender was the part of a telephone a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the sender on the other end of the line.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>New media is any media – from newspaper articles and blogs to music and podcasts – that are delivered digitally. From a website or email to mobile phones and streaming apps, any internet-related form of communication can be considered new media. ... Other new media are entirely new, such as a podcast or smartphone app.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The Aristotle's communication model is a speaker centered model as the speaker has the most important role in it and is the only one active. It is the speaker's role to deliver a speech to the audience. ... This makes the communication process one way, from speaker to receiver.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Models of communication are conceptual models used to explain the human communication process. ... Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Using theprevious article classify each paragraph to I, B, and C.Online education is far more affordable as compared to physical learning. Thisis because online learning eliminates the cost points of student transportation,student meals, and most importantly, real estate.Additionally, all the course or study materials are available online, thuscreating a paperless learning environment which is more affordable, while alsobeing beneficial to the environment.For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is thestruggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. With online learning,there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by social media orother sites.Therefore, it is imperative for the teachers to keep their online classes crisp,engaging, and interactive to help students stay focused on the lesson.​</h2><br />

                            23. what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</h2><br />
