                        The Story of <strong>Elijah and the Prophets of the False Gods</strong><strong></strong><strong>Characters:</strong><p><strong>Elijah </strong>- a prophet of the true God Yahweh (also known as Jehovah)</p><p><strong>King Ahab </strong>- ruling king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel</p><p><strong>Prophets of Baal</strong> - 450 men who served under the idol Baal</p><p><strong>Prophets of Asherah</strong> - 450 men who served under the idol Asherah</p>Location: Mount Carmel<p>Notes</p><strong>Yahweh</strong> is the true God and known Protector of the Israelites<strong>Baal</strong> is a false god and idol worshipped by the Canaanites<strong>Asherah</strong> is a false goddess and idol worshipped by Akkadians and HittitesThe story can be found in the <strong>book of First of Kings, chapters 18 to 19</strong>.<p></p>Story<p>Since the division of Israel into two separate kingdoms, the Israelites have lost their faith and devotion to the true God, Yahweh. Some of them still worship Yahweh, some will worship Yahweh while also worshipping other false gods. This was something that does not please Yahweh at all since he wants people to give him undivided and unfailing devotion.</p><p>One of the reasons why the Israelites strayed from God is because of the influences from the surrounding nations and tribes who worshipped idols and inanimate objects. Instead of being good examples and being positive influences, they allowed themselves to be led astray because they thought that by being accepted by these other nations would bring them wealth and security. </p><p>One example is King Ahab, the ruler of the northern kingdom. He was married to a Sidonian princess named Jezebel. She was a worshipper of false gods. When they were married, she demanded a temple to be built for Baal and a prayer pole for Asherah. She even had hundreds of prophets of Yahweh slain by the sword. King Ahab also allowed people to worship the golden statues of calves.</p><p>Elijah, one of the remaining devotees of Yahweh and also a prophet that speaks his will, would often bravely condemn ungodly acts and also speak of God's will. Yahweh spoke through Elijah about a warning and prophecy that if the nation does not change for the good, a severe drought and famine will befall the land. This angered Ahab and many others.</p><p>When Elijah faced the king, he suggested that they have a trial at the Mount Carmel so that they would know who the true God is. </p><p>The prophets of Baal, the prophets of Asherah, the Israelites, and King Ahab went to Mount Carmel to meet with Elijah for the trial. The prophets of false gods built their own wooden altar were they sacrificed a slain bull. The trial would be that the bull that would burst into a fire would signify which god was real.</p><p>The prophets of Baal and the prophets of Asherah prayed and wailed, harder and louder every passing moment and with much fervor but nothing happened. </p><p>By noontime, it was already Elijah's turn. He restored the altar he previously constructed but destroyed by the prophets. He sacrificed the bull and cut it to pieces. He also made sure that a moat of water was to surround the altar. Elijah stepped back and prayed to Yahweh. Not long after, the bull burst into flames in Yahweh's approval.</p><p>This show of faith impressed the Israelites and reminded most of who the real God is. However, King Ahab and the prophets of the false gods were even more furious because they were humiliated and proven wrong.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope this answer helped you!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Elijah and Elisha were two of the most prominent prophets in the Old Testament, and their messages differed from those of other prophets in several ways.</p><p></p><p>Elijah was a prophet during the reign of King Ahab of Israel and his wife Jezebel, who were known for their worship of the god Baal. Elijah's message was focused on calling the people of Israel back to the worship of the one true God, Yahweh. He performed many miracles, including calling down fire from heaven to consume a sacrifice and bringing a dead child back to life. Elijah's message was often confrontational and he spoke out against the sins of the people and their leaders.</p><p></p><p>Elisha was Elijah's successor and continued his work of calling the people back to the worship of Yahweh. Elisha also performed many miracles, including healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and multiplying oil. Elisha's message was more focused on compassion and caring for those in need.</p><p></p><p>Both Elijah and Elisha were known for their prophetic miracles, such as healing the sick and raising the dead. They also both had a close relationship with God and were called to serve as his messengers. However, their messages differed in tone and emphasis. Elijah's message was often more confrontational and focused on calling out sin, while Elisha's message was more compassionate and focused on helping those in need</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

Elijah will also do the same.</p><p>The prophets of Baal cried from morning till midday, but nothing happens. Then Elijah took his turn, he cried to Yahweh saying: "Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that these people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again."</p><p>Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice. God did what Baal could never do. Through this, Elijah proved that Yahweh is the only true God and Baal is a false god.</p><p><strong> (1 Kings 18:15-39)</strong></p><br />

The prophet Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal to a contest to determine whose God was truly the God of Israel. Each side was to build an altar and place a bull on it, but not set it on fire. The God who answered with fire and consumed the offering would be declared the true God. Elijah built an altar to Yahweh and the prophets of Baal built an altar to Baal. The contest ended with Yahweh sending fire from heaven to consume Elijah's offering, while the prophets of Baal were unsuccessful in their attempts to call upon Baal.</p><br />

What was the prophets used to proclaim their message to the people of Israel?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The prophet Amos lived among a group of shepherds in Tekoa, a small town approximately ten miles south of Jerusalem. Amos made clear in his writings that he did not come from a family of prophets, nor did he even consider himself one. Rather, he was “a grower of sycamore figs” as well as a shepherd (Amos 7:14–15). Amos’s connection to the simple life of the people made its way into the center of his prophecies, as he showed a heart for the oppressed and the voiceless in the world.</p><p></p><p>Where are we?</p><p>Amos prophesied “two years before the earthquake” (Amos 1:1; see also Zechariah 14:5), just before the halfway point of the eighth century BC, during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam, king of Israel. Their reigns overlapped for fifteen years, from 767 BC to 753 BC.</p><p></p><p>Though he came from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos delivered his prophecy against the northern kingdom of Israel and the surrounding nations, leading to some resistance from the prideful Israelites (Amos 7:12). Jeroboam’s reign had been quite profitable for the northern kingdom, at least in a material sense. However, the moral decay that also occurred at that time counteracted any positives from the material growth.</p><p></p><p>Why is Amos so important?</p><p>Amos was fed up. While most of the prophets interspersed redemption and restoration in their prophecies against Israel and Judah, Amos devoted only the final five verses of his prophecy for such consolation. Prior to that, God’s word through Amos was directed against the privileged people of Israel, a people who had no love for their neighbor, who took advantage of others, and who only looked out for their own concerns.</p><p></p><p>More than almost any other book of Scripture, the book of Amos holds God’s people accountable for their ill-treatment of others. It repeatedly points out the failure of the people to fully embrace God’s idea of justice. They were selling off needy people for goods, taking advantage of the helpless, oppressing the poor, and the men were using women immorally (Amos 2:6–8; 3:10; 4:1; 5:11–12; 8:4–6). Drunk on their own economic success and intent on strengthening their financial position, the people had lost the concept of caring for one another; Amos rebuked them because he saw in that lifestyle evidence that Israel had forgotten God.</p><p></p><p>What's the big idea?</p><p>With the people of Israel in the north enjoying an almost unparalleled time of success, God decided to call a quiet shepherd and farmer to travel from his home in the less sinful south and carry a message of judgment to the Israelites. The people in the north used Amos’s status as a foreigner as an excuse to ignore his message of judgment for a multiplicity of sins.</p><p></p><p>However, while their outer lives gleamed with the rays of success, their inner lives sank into a pit of moral decay. Rather than seeking out opportunities to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly, they embraced their arrogance, idolatry, self-righteousness, and materialism. Amos communicated God’s utter disdain for the hypocritical lives of His people (Amos 5:21–24). His prophecy concludes with only a brief glimpse of restoration, and even that is directed to Judah, rather than the northern kingdom of Israel (9:11–15).</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
