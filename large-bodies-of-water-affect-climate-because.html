A biome is a large, stable terrestrial ecosystem with specific plant and animalcommunities.2. Biomes are divided based on climate patterns, soil types, and the animals andplants that inhabit an area3. The divisions of the aquatic biome are determined by the amount of salt / saltcontent.4. There are three main climate zones on Earth that help our biomes - Tropical,Temperate, and Polar.5. Landforms, such as mountain ranges and large bodies of water do not affect theclimate.6. Tropical rainforest is found far away the Equator. The climate is hot and humidand some few species can be found here.7. Temperate deciduous forests are found across Europe and in the USA. Thesetrees lose their leaves every year and thrive in mild and wet conditions known asa temperate maritime climate.8. Savanna grassland is found mainly in central Africa, southern India, northernAustralia and central South America. Long grasses and a few scattered trees arefound in these hot and dry conditions.9.Climate is not good for our health and health of animals10.Stop Smoking because the ozone layer is becoming thin.​</a>
