Some people think recesses in school should be longer. They believe kids might
learn better if they had a longer break in the middle of the day. However, the extra
class time after recess would make the school day longer. Therefore, kids would
get out of school later in the day. What do you think? Support your opinion with

                                            for various reasons, I believe that morning recess needs to be extended because it does not allow students enough time to take care of their basic needs. Some people may disagree because they feel that this will decrease instructional and learning time. However, I believe that a longer recess will allow students time to drink water and go to the bathroom. also, students will have time to play team sports. finally, the most important reason is students will have enough time to eat their healthy snacks. consequently, I will argue that an extended recess benefits students learning.

                        <p>Learning Task 2: </p><p>Recess has indeed been significant upon every student, it is beneficial especially when students need to rest and break free from stress and get some fresh air while filling up their stomach from hunger. Every student  needs to rest their brain to help them think correctly, in order to have a piece of mind. We all know with the standard, "wake up early - school for hours - assignments at home" routine of most students. Without a doubt, students haven't got enough rest nor time to process every lesson they tackle. So why not give them a little more time to have their recess properly? Research shows that when children have recess, they gain improved memory and be more focused attention, which thus develop more brain connections.</p><p>Having more time in recess means that they will have more time to eat their food too, right? By having enough time, their body will no longer be overwhelmed by how fast they consume their food, thus getting a balanced and healthier bodies. Children might even get a lot more active and flexible! They will for sure enjoy sports and other physical activities too since they had their meal properly without rushing it. It is beneficial for students to be more creative when they come up with games and activities to fill the time.  </p><p>Longer recess time means longer school hours but favorably, I think school hours will no longer need to be affected since long recess time means they will have time to recharge and will undoubtedly become much more active on tasks. They wouldn't take up much time on figuring things out within school hours, for instance; recitation, group activities, individual reporting—wouldn't it be more advisable if your student won't take much time upon fidgeting or stuttering during reporting because they already had time to prepare theirselves on recess? With good mentally state for the students they can enjoy and will be more focused in the class even and study effectively!</p><p>Lastly, if students get to hang out even just for a while after a long period discussion, they can have fun and socialize such as sharing and talking about their favorite snacks etc. Children will no longer have to bother being noisy and gossiping throughout the class due to the fact that they already had the time to interact during recess time, which gave them the chance to let their energy and thoughts out. They will not fill the classroom with noised and won't fool around each other. Who wouldn't want a quite and focused students while teaching? Less stress.</p><p>In summarize everything that has been stated, it is only reasonable to make the recess  longer since it positively impacts mental state makes the learning environment fresher in a way. We shouldn't put pressure into them, so that they can fullfill their daily task properly without distractions.  With these reasons gathered and discussed, children will have the  time to regain their energy. Learning is made to be fun and giving them longer recces will help their brain function properly and will have the ability to focus their goals. There is no way that making the recess longer is such a bad decision to do so. This will significantly make it convenient not just for the students, but  for everyone as well.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One reason why recess should be longer is that kids need to be more physical to have healthier bodies. With more recess, kids might get a lot more flexible! Kids will get really good at sports too, which is a very important skill. Tag, soccer, football, climbing - now that's physical!</p><p></p><p>Kids also really need to play! An important part of childhood is having fun, and kids can't really play longer more interesting games with just 15 minutes of recess. Longer recess will help kids be more creative when they come up with games and activities to fill the time. Kids would even learn to get along more with a longer recess. They would have time to talk and solve problems. Kids who get bored or have a tough time in class will feel good about school when they have recess.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, with more recess kids will do better with their school work. That sounds like the opposite, but it's true. With more recess, kids would let all their energy out in recess time. Kids will be really quiet and focused in class all because of recess. Kids will not run in the classroom or ever fool around again.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps! goodluck</p><br />

If not, students won’t be able to focus in class, get enough exercise to be healthy, or interact with other kids and make friends. Therefore, recess must be longer. if students have longer recess they will burn off energy and can focus more in class. Also, students need time to clear their minds and absorb what they learned. Recess gives students something to look forward to so they will work harder in class.As you probably already know, recess is a chance to get exercise and receive Vitamin D from the sun. If students don’t get exercise they won’t be healthy.Students need to be healthy to do well in school. Students need recess to interact with each other and make friends. If they have even longer recess they will make even more friends.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student who don't have any time to relax and resets my mind during classes,it is essential to have a longer recess for the students just like me. </p><p></p><p></p><p>What are the reasons why students need to have a longer recess?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>First on the list is to free your mind or thoughts. Students nowadays spent a lot time doing scheduled activities,also known as homeworks. For my experience in this situation,recess is the mostly one can actually get to free my mind.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Second is the mental health. Why? Long hours in the classroom can take a toll on the mental health of students. They usually take large amount of homeworks,after a long day of learning at school leading them to feel stressed. A longer recess could easily add enough movement to help them to minimize their mental discomfort.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Lastly,more patient teachers. Teachers often get worn out from working and teaching their students. Recess allows them to take a break,giving their minds some rest. Teachers are able to show more kindness and patience and once class resumes,the teacher feel much calmer than before.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>So anyways,my points is we can also focus and relax on the other things and such if we had a longer recess. And also,longer recess would give a positive impact for all the students and teachers.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I (Introduction): As solo travel can be the ultimate in self-indulgence, learning how to do it is each one's innate ability, and something that can be learned today.
</p><p>
</p><p>Body:MI (1st Main Idea) The first way to travel solo successfully is to arrive well-informed on the area.
</p><p>
</p><p>Details: Use money belt as a purse not for storage. Keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other documents in a theft-resistant bag. It may pose perils here and there but a little preparation and common sense can get you through the rough spots.
</p><p>
</p><p>MI (2nd Main Idea) In addition, also in line with safety, you must have to carry good identification in more than one place.
</p><p>
</p><p>Details: Freya Stark once said "To awake quite alone in a strange town is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world".
</p><p>
</p><p>MI (3rd Main Idea) Details Finally in terms of fun, pacj for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record you adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop.
</p><p>
</p><p>C(Conclusion): Your security is at risk when you are trapped in abusy street scanning frequently the GPS on your phone while looking for a place to eat or stay. It also matters if you booked for your accommodation in advance and are in the know of public transfort system. Travelling alone is an achievable feat.

Some people may disagree because they feel that this will decrease instructional and learning time. However, I believe that a longer recess will allow students time to drink water and go to the bathroom. also, students will have time to play team sports. finally, the most important reason is students will have enough time to eat their healthy snacks. consequently, I will argue that an extended recess benefits students learning.

                        <p><strong>                                 CURFEW FOR TEENAGERS</strong></p><p>                   </p><p> Having no discipline in the child’s life is usually blamed on the parents but without their parents around what can put into place and show them discipline. Usually boys 7-to-10 years old that grow up without a father will be a malicious or nefarious group of criminals that the nation has ever known. (Love, Dennis 1). The police find that curfews also help border-line problem children whose parents do not care. (Hall, Maggie 2). Having a positive role model in a child’s life can have a tremendous outcome on their teenage years. Instead of lecturing their teen the family should have a consultation and tell them why a curfew is important and why they should follow rules. The parents should have a consequence for the teen not following the curfew and follow through with it so the teen knows the consequence of not following the rules established by parents and it will not be taken so lightly.Teenagers that appear to have bad grades can mean their curfew is not extensive enough or their parents do not care or know what their child is doing after he or she gets home from school. By having a curfew for one’s teen can prove to help teens better themselves in school and increase respect in the household. Growing up without limits makes teens feel like they are not worthy or the parents really do not care what they do. Having limits can show a teen what they are and are not capable of handling until they learn from experience. Giving one’s teen a curfew is giving them freedom to hang out with friends and appreciate other activities with limits. By having a curfew for your teen shows them that even when they grow up they will have to abide by rules like the laws and orders from their boss. Some feel that curfews are centered on discrimination, negative stereotypes and prejudicial claims. Having a curfew cannot be emphasized enough. Curfew can show the discipline in teens and show how much they care about their life and how much the parents of the teens care.</p><p><strong>Explanation:YOU CAN CUT IT KUNG MAHABA NG SOBRA THANKS</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

If not, students won't be able to focus in class, get enough exercise to be healthy, or interact with other kids and make friends. Therefore, recess must be longer.

                        <strong>ANSWER</strong><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Recess is an important part of the school day that provides children with a much-needed break from academic work. However, some people argue that the length of recess should be increased to provide children with more time to play and socialize. In this essay, I will examine the reasons why some people believe recesses in school should be longer.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>One reason why some people believe that recess should be longer is that it provides children with an opportunity to be physically active. Longer recess periods can give children more time to run, play, and engage in physical activities, which can be beneficial for their overall health and well-being. Additionally, longer recess periods can help children burn off excess energy and improve their focus and attention during academic work.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why some people think recesses in school should be longer is that it can help children develop social skills. During recess, children have the opportunity to interact with their peers, form friendships, and develop important social skills such as cooperation, communication, and problem-solving. Longer recess periods can give children more time to engage in social activities and develop these skills, which can benefit them both academically and personally.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, some people argue that recesses in school should be longer to provide children with more time to play, be physically active, and develop important social skills. While longer recess periods may have some benefits, it is important to balance these with the need for academic work and classroom instruction. Ultimately, the length of recess should be determined based on the needs of individual schools and the students they serve.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>ITS </strong><strong>HELP</strong><strong>CARRYONLEARNING </strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is essential that recess is longer. If not, students won’t be able to focus in class, get enough exercise to be healthy, or interact with other kids and make friends. Therefore, recess must be longer.
</p><p>  </p><p>If students have longer recess they will burn off energy and can focus more in class. Also, students need time to clear their minds and absorb what they learned. Recess gives students something to look forward to so they will work harder in class.  </p><p>  </p><p>As you probably already know, recess is a chance to get exercise and receive Vitamin D from the sun. If students don’t get exercise they won’t be healthy.
</p><p>  
</p><p>Students need to be healthy to do well in school. Students need recess to interact with each other and make friends. If they have even longer recess they will make even more friends. If students have friends in school and in class they won’t get bored in school.                                                                                   </p><p>    </p><p> These reasons Focus, Exercise, and Student Interaction demonstrate why recess absolutely has to be longer. The time to act is now, because if we don’t act now, when? When will we make longer recess so children will be happier and healthier? Obviously, we act now or never!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps pls brainliest me pls</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Students must have a time for recess everyday.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Recess has also shown to play an important role in maintaining students’ physical state as well. Generally, students spend most of their time sitting at a desk, and even if some form of movement is involved, it is usually restricted to walking around the classroom. This is not nearly enough activity for a child.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: No Sodas and Empty Calorie Foods in School Canteens</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "You are what you eat." It is essential to instill healthy eating habits in children, and one way to do that is by banning sodas and empty calorie foods in school canteens. This policy will benefit not only the students but also the entire school community.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sodas and empty calorie foods do not provide the necessary nutrients that students need to grow and learn. These foods are high in sugar, fat, and calories, which can lead to weight gain, obesity, and other health problems. By banning these foods, students will be encouraged to eat healthier options such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are rich in essential nutrients and vitamins that are beneficial for their growth and development.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the removal of sodas and empty calorie foods in school canteens will promote a healthier school environment. Students who consume these unhealthy foods are more likely to be distracted, hyperactive, and irritable, which can affect their academic performance and behavior. By removing these foods from the canteens, the school can create a more positive and conducive learning environment, which will benefit the students and the entire school community.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, banning sodas and empty calorie foods in school canteens is a step towards promoting healthy eating habits in children. It will provide students with healthier options, which are necessary for their growth and development, and promote a more positive and conducive learning environment. Therefore, I strongly support this policy and urge schools to implement it for the benefit of their students..</p><p>PA BRAINLEST NAMAN PO</p><br />
