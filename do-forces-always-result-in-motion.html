                                            Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the final example of the last section, we saw how we could calculate a dynamic acceleration based on a vector pointing from a circle on the screen to the mouse position. The resulting motion resembled a magnetic attraction between circle and mouse, as if some force were pulling the circle in towards the mouse.</p><p>In this section, we will formalize our understanding of the concept of a force and its relationship to acceleration. Our goal, by the end of this, is to understand how to make multiple objects move around the screen and respond to a variety of environmental forces.</p><p>Before we begin examining the practical realities of simulating forces in code, let’s take a conceptual look at what it means to be a force in the real world. Just like the word “vector,” “force” is often used to mean a variety of things. It can indicate a powerful intensity, as in “She pushed the boulder with great force” or “He spoke forcefully.” The definition of force that we care about is much more formal and comes from Isaac Newton’s laws of motion:</p><p>A force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate.</p><p>The good news here is that we recognize the first part of the definition: a force is a vector.

                        a force can give energy to an object causing the object to start moving, stop moving, or change its motion. Forces occur in pairs and can be either balanced or unbalanced. Balanced forces do not cause a change in motion. They are equal in size and opposite in direction.<br />:)<br />

Do forces always result in motion?</strong></p><p><strong>No</strong>, When you just standing in the floor without moving, you are exerting force to the floor. We called it the <strong>gravitational force</strong> (Weight). It is true that we use force to create motion, but there are times that force is present without motion. If you put a rock on top of the table, it exert force and the table also exert force on the rock, yet both of them are not exerting motion.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>1. Once you apply a force to an object, it will move. ... If the answer is zero, as in one force pulling one way and the other pulling the opposite direction exactly, then those forces will basically cancel each other out. So yes, forces will always result in motion, unless there is another force exactly opposed to it.<p> </p>2. If two individual forces are of equal magnitude and opposite direction, then the forces are said to be balanced.

                            24. Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

                        not all, but we know that forces always result in motion, when you apply force on an object,absolutely the object will move. altering distance and speed,  <br />but not all forces will always result in motion, like balanced force a force that is exerted balance or equal. <br />example: pushing a 15 n box with opposite direction.<br />this means that you are pushing  each other in opposite direction with no changing of motion. the force and motion will remain zero.<br />unlike the unbalanced force that there are always changing of motion. because they are not equal..... no because sometimes you're pushing something that is pushing you<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong> force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Motion, in physics, change with time of the position or orientation of a body. Motion along a line or a curve is called translation. ... In both cases all points in the body have the same velocity (directed speed) and the same acceleration (time rate of change of velocity).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Once you apply a force to an object, it will move. ... If the answer is zero, as in one force pulling one way and the other pulling the opposite direction exactly, then those forces will basically cancel each other out. So yes, forces will always result in motion, unless there is another force exactly opposed to it.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>3</strong><strong> </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>o</strong><strong>f</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>-</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity. This includes changes to the object's speed, or direction of motion. An aspect of this property is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at a constant speed, when no forces act upon them. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Inertia, property of a body by virtue of which it opposes any agency that attempts to put it in motion or, if it is moving, to change the magnitude or direction of its velocity. Inertia is a passive property and does not enable a body to do anything except oppose such active agents as forces and torques.</strong></p><p></p><p>-<strong>F</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Acceleration, rate at which velocity changes with time, in terms of both speed and direction. ... A point or an object moving in a straight line is accelerated if it speeds up or slows down. Motion on a circle is accelerated even if the speed is constant, because the direction is continually changing.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Power is the amount of work that gets done in a given period. Work on the other and is the action required to effect a change in the position of the object.

Temperature describes the average kinetic energy of molecules within a material or system and is measured in Celsius (°C), Kelvin(K), Fahrenheit (°F), or Rankine (R).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>When solid, liquids or gases absorbs or release heat they change their states. ... The addition of the kinetic energy to the molecules makes the attraction between molecules decrease changing the states of the matter. In this case, solids will become liquid and this process is called melting.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The current is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance. This means that increasing the voltage will cause the current to increase, while increasing the resistance will cause the current to decrease.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><strong>DON'T plug a bunch of stuff into one outlet or extension cord. It could damage the electrical system in your house or even cause a fire.</strong><strong>DO make sure all electric cords are tucked out of the way. Pets might chew on electrical cords, and people might trip and fall.</strong><strong>DON'T ever play near or on a green transformer box or climb the fence around an electrical substation. If a ball or pet gets inside the fence, ask an adult to call Alliant Energy or your electric company - they'll come and get it out for you.</strong><strong>DON'T yank an electrical cord from the wall. Instead, pull from the plug. Pulling on a cord can damage the appliance, the plug or the outlet.</strong><strong>DON'T fly anything like drones or kites near power lines or substations. A kite and its string may conduct electricity - sending it right through you to the ground.</strong><strong>DO ask an adult for help when you need to use something that uses electricity.</strong><strong>DO look up and look out for power lines before you climb a tree. The electricity can go right through the tree branch - and right through you.</strong><strong>DO have an adult put safety caps on all unused electrical outlets. Covering outlets will also help save energy by stopping cold drafts.</strong><strong>DO watch out for power lines when using a ladder, chainsaw or other outdoor equipment.</strong><strong>DO keep electrical stuff away from water.
