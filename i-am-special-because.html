                                            Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

                                            create a critique With Introduction,Body and Conclusion of this story The Parable Of The Rainbow Colors By:Juan M. Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

14.This morning was crazy. First, My alarm clock was set for PM instead of AM, so I woke up really late. I just threw on some clothes and ran out the door. Then, I rode my bike as fast as I could and thought that I was going to be late for sure, but when I got there everyone was outside and there were firetrucks all lined up in front of school. I guess somebody pulled the fire alarm before class started. It worked out though, because nobody really noticed or minded that I was ta rdy.

                                                       My Mother, My Strength!   My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.   She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which I envy.   They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then, I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher she never pushes students and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job. My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. 'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes.   My mom is the dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness. Questions:What is the introduction? Body? Conclusion? What are written in the first paragraph?

1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</a>

                            4. Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow.

                            13. create a critique With Introduction,Body and Conclusion of this story The Parable Of The Rainbow Colors By:Juan M. Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors, written by Juan M. Flavier, is a short story that depicts a quarrel among different colors, each claiming to be the best. However, their dispute is interrupted by the rain, which teaches them a valuable lesson of cooperation and hope. In this critique, I will analyze the story's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on its theme, characters, and plot.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The story's strength lies in its theme of cooperation and hope. The rain's intervention serves as a reminder to the colors that they need to work together to create something beautiful. The rainbow, which symbolizes unity and diversity, represents the idea that everyone has a unique role to play in the world. This theme is particularly relevant in today's world, where people often divide themselves into factions based on race, religion, or political beliefs. The story's message is clear: we need to learn to work together, despite our differences, to create a better world.</p><p></p><p>However, the story's characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The colors are defined solely by their attributes, such as red representing courage, yellow representing warmth, and green representing life. While this is a clever way of introducing the characters, it doesn't leave much room for character development. Additionally, the colors' argumentative nature feels forced, as if they were only created to serve the story's purpose rather than having a natural motivation to argue with one another.</p><p></p><p>The story's plot is simple and effective, but it lacks depth. The argument between the colors is resolved quickly, and the story ends with a simple solution. While this is suitable for a parable, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced resolution. The story could have explored the colors' individual strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be combined to create something even more beautiful than a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors is a simple but effective story with a powerful message of cooperation and hope. While the characters and plot could have been more developed, the story succeeds in conveying its theme to readers. Overall, the story serves as a reminder that we need to work together to create a better world, despite our differences.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

14.This morning was crazy. First, My alarm clock was set for PM instead of AM, so I woke up really late. I just threw on some clothes and ran out the door. Then, I rode my bike as fast as I could and thought that I was going to be late for sure, but when I got there everyone was outside and there were firetrucks all lined up in front of school. I guess somebody pulled the fire alarm before class started. It worked out though, because nobody really noticed or minded that I was ta rdy.

                            20.            My Mother, My Strength!   My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.   She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which I envy.   They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then, I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher she never pushes students and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job. My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. 'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes.   My mom is the dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness. Questions:What is the introduction? Body? Conclusion? What are written in the first paragraph?

                            25. Citing Evidence and Reaction about the story, Parable of Rainbow Colors using C.A.L.M and D.O.W.N strategies.Here's the Story.The Parable Of The Rainbow Colors Juan M. FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism.The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</h2><br />

                            26. Summarize
1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</h2><br />
