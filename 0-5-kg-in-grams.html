                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The answer is <strong>B. </strong>because it is the correct and accurate representation of the metric scale system.</p><p>2. <strong>B.</strong> because all you have to do is move the decimal point to the right three times and we must know that a kilo, meaning thousand, kilogram is equivalent to 1000 meters.</p><p>3. <strong>C.</strong>, the reverse of number 2., we move the decimal place three times to the left.</p><p>4. I do not know if you've put the wrong choices BUT, the closest to being truth in all of the answers is letter <strong>B.</strong> Recheck na lamang if it is wrong or correct.</p><p>5. <strong>D. </strong>Covert the 20cm to meters, in which we should get 500meters, then divide the 500 by 20 getting 25cm can be cut in 5 m.</p><p>6. 1.5dm    = 15cm</p><p>                       8.2cm</p><p>   62.8mm =   6.28  add them all and we get 29.48cm making <strong>B.</strong> the answer</p><p>7. <strong>A.</strong> because mg is the most required unit of measurement to be used in getting the mass of a medicine capsule.</p><p>8. <strong>B.</strong> because you just need to move the decimal point of 375 three times.</p><p>9. <strong>C. </strong>first convert 25kg to grams making it 25 000grams then divide 25 000 to 500 and you'll get 50.</p><p>10. Either B. or C. but I would say <strong>B.</strong> because it really is easier to convert than English system and metric system is not use by all regions that's why some uses English system.</p><p></p><p>THIS IS AS FAR AS I CAN GO TO ANSWER<br />HOPE THIS STILL HELPS YOU :)<br />AND CAN YOU KINDLY GIVE ME THE BRAINLIEST ANSWER.
