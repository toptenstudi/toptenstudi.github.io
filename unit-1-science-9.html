SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

                            4. Unit 1. SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

The standard unit of measurement of distance or length in metric system is miles,2. Meterstick, tape measure, and sturdy rope are some of the standard tools in measuringdistance.3. Yard, foot, and inch are units of measurement used in the metric system of measurement.4. The measure of how far or near two points are from one another is called distance.5. The metric system of measurement of distance is used only in the Philippines.6. In science, distance should always be exact, measured accurately, and based on any unit ofmeasurement.7. The English system of measurement is used by scientists throughout the world.8. Using different units of measurement may lead to misunderstanding and confusion amongpeople.9. Ten kilometers is equal to 1000 meters.10. Speed can be calculated by multiplying the distance covered by an object in motion by theamount of time it used to cover the distance.​​</h2><br />

The standard unit of measurement of distance or length in metric system is miles,2. Meterstick, tape measure, and sturdy rope are some of the standard tools in measuringdistance.3. Yard, foot, and inch are units of measurement used in the metric system of measurement.4. The measure of how far or near two points are from one another is called distance.5. The metric system of measurement of distance is used only in the Philippines.6. In science, distance should always be exact, measured accurately, and based on any unit ofmeasurement.7. The English system of measurement is used by scientists throughout the world.8. Using different units of measurement may lead to misunderstanding and confusion amongpeople.9.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.False:The standard unit of measurement of distance or length in metric system is meter. Miles is the standard unit of measurement of distance or length in U.S. system. Metric system is also known as decimalised system in terms of measurement.</p><p>2.True</p><p>3.false:because all of those are in the english system</p><p>4.true</p><p>5.false:because not only in Philippines.</p><p>6.False:Distance is a measure for how far objects are. It is a quantitative measurement that needs to be always exact and measured accurately. ... Thus, stating that it can be measured base on any unit of measurement would be incorrect.</p><p>7.False:scientists throughout the word use the standard measurement system which is called International System of Units, or SI.</p><p>8.True</p><p>9. False:10 km to m conversion. A kilometer, or kilometre, is a unit of length equal to 1,000 meters, or about 0.621 miles.
