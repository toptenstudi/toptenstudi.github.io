                                            Read the recount below and answer the questions that follow.
 My Wonderful Weekend
On the weekend, my cousins came to stay from out of town. Their names are
Jeremy and Georgia. I love spending time with them.
Firstly, we went to the huge playground at the park near our house. Jeremy,
Georgia, and I pretended that we were fierce pirates. We felt so brave, bold, and
adventurous!
After that, we had a picnic lunch on the grass under the trees. We ate some
delicious sandwiches, fruit and cake. Jeremy loved the chocolate cake so much
that he ate three pieces!
Next, we all went to the cinema. My cousins and I felt overjoyed and very
excited about going to see a movie. It was scary and funny with a happy ending.
I loved spending the weekend with Jeremy and Georgia. I feel so lucky to have
such wonderful cousins. I hope they can come and stay at my house again very
soon.

 My Wonderful Weekend
On the weekend, my cousins came to stay from out of town. Their names are
Jeremy and Georgia. I love spending time with them.
Firstly, we went to the huge playground at the park near our house. Jeremy,
Georgia, and I pretended that we were fierce pirates. We felt so brave, bold, and
adventurous!
After that, we had a picnic lunch on the grass under the trees. We ate some
delicious sandwiches, fruit and cake. Jeremy loved the chocolate cake so much
that he ate three pieces!
Next, we all went to the cinema. My cousins and I felt overjoyed and very
excited about going to see a movie. It was scary and funny with a happy ending.
I loved spending the weekend with Jeremy and Georgia. I feel so lucky to have
such wonderful cousins. I hope they can come and stay at my house again very
soon.
