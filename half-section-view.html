Write your answers on the provided answer sheet found at the end of the learning activity sheets 1. Sectional view is purposely drawn to show the inside portion of the object. 2. Cutting Plane line is a fine line used to show the part of the object being cut. 3. Section Line is an imaginary line along which shows where an object is imagined cut to obtain a sectional view. 4. Section lines indicate the solid areas of a part. 5. Section line indicates the material from which a part is made. 6. Half Section is a type of sectional view that shows the entire cut surface of the view. 7. Full Section is a resulting view when the cutting plane is imagined at half-way across the object. 8. Broken-out Section is a type of view when there is portion of the view being taken out. 9. Revolved Section is a type of section applied to a circular object. The resulting view is similar to full section view. 10. Removed Section is generally used in furniture, machine, and architectural drawing. The appearance of the sectional view depends on the location of the cutting - plane lines. 11. Offset Section shows the zigzag direction of the cutting plane if the principal interior features of an object are not located in a straight line, it is necessary to offset the cutting - plane line to allow to pass through as many of the principal features of the object. 12.Assembly Section is a made up of a combination of the parts of all other section drawings. This section may be used to increase the clarity and readability of assembly drawings. 13.Sectioning shows more detailed illustration particularly on the internal parts of the object. 14.Section lines is an inclined line that forms 45 degrees angle. Each line must have at least 2mm distance from each other. 15.The direction of the cutting plane line is a major reference to consider in determining the form of view to be drawn. -​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>A half section exposes the interior of one half of an object while retaining the exterior of the other half.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> A revolved section shows the shape of an object by rotating a section 90 degrees to face the viewer. The three revolved sections illustrated in the spear-like object of figure 12 show the changes that take place in its shape.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>A removed section is a section or partial section not directly projected from the view containing the cutting plane and not revolved or turned from its normal  orientation.    A removed section does not align with any other view, but,  sometimes  appears  on  centerlines  extended  from  the  section  cuts.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Assembly section is a presentation of a structure or product with its components connected together, in their relative working positions while in use.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>This is the most common section (called a full section) with the imaginary laser cutting a line across the entire construction, offering a view of a portion of the building with the rest of it put to one side.</p><p><strong>6. </strong>A broken-out section view cuts away a portion of an assembly in a drawing view to expose the inside. Cross hatching is automatically generated on the sectioned faces of all components. A broken-out section is part of an existing drawing view, not a separate view.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>An offset section is a means of including in a single section several features of an object that are not in a straight line. To do this, the cutting plane line is bent, or “OFFSET” to pass through the features of the part.</p><p><strong>8. </strong>Section lines are special lines placed on a drawing which indicate the area of the drawing through which an imaginary cut has been made to reveal internal details.</p><p><strong>9. </strong>Cutting plane lines are thick lines that run through the center of the object that the interior wants to provide an interior view of. Two perpendicular lines with arrows showing in which direction the interior of the object should be viewed are drawn at the end of the line</p><p><strong>10. </strong>A sectional view represents the part of an object remaining after a portion is assumed to have been cut and removed. The exposed cut surface is then indicated by section lines. Hidden features behind the cutting plane are omitted, unless required for dimensioning or for definition of the part.</p><br />

Place an F on the line if you think the statement is FALSE, 1. The half section drawing is not normally used where the dimensioning of external diameters is required. 2. A cutting-plane line will not indicate where the imaginary cutting takes place 3. The offset section is made by revolving the cross section. 4. The spacing of the hatching lines is not uniform to give a good appearance to the drawing 5. The half section drawing is not normally used where the dimensioning of internal diameters is required. 6. Section lining indicates the surface that has been cut and makes it stand out clearly. Section lines usually consist of thin parallel lines, drawn at an angle of approximately 30 degrees. 7. Sectional views, commonly called sections, are used to show interior detail that is too complicated to be shown clearly and dimensioned by the traditional orthographic views and hidden lines. 8. A symmetrical object or assembly may be drawn as a half section. 9. When the revolved view is superimposed on the part, the original lines of the part behind the section are deleted.10. Section lining is similar in direction and spacing in all sections of a single component​</h2><br />

Write your answers on the provided answer sheet found at the end of the learning activity sheets 1. Sectional view is purposely drawn to show the inside portion of the object. 2. Cutting Plane line is a fine line used to show the part of the object being cut. 3. Section Line is an imaginary line along which shows where an object is imagined cut to obtain a sectional view. 4. Section lines indicate the solid areas of a part. 5. Section line indicates the material from which a part is made. 6. Half Section is a type of sectional view that shows the entire cut surface of the view. 7. Full Section is a resulting view when the cutting plane is imagined at half-way across the object. 8. Broken-out Section is a type of view when there is portion of the view being taken out. 9. Revolved Section is a type of section applied to a circular object. The resulting view is similar to full section view. 10. Removed Section is generally used in furniture, machine, and architectural drawing. The appearance of the sectional view depends on the location of the cutting - plane lines. 11. Offset Section shows the zigzag direction of the cutting plane if the principal interior features of an object are not located in a straight line, it is necessary to offset the cutting - plane line to allow to pass through as many of the principal features of the object. 12.Assembly Section is a made up of a combination of the parts of all other section drawings. This section may be used to increase the clarity and readability of assembly drawings. 13.Sectioning shows more detailed illustration particularly on the internal parts of the object. 14.Section lines is an inclined line that forms 45 degrees angle. Each line must have at least 2mm distance from each other. 15.The direction of the cutting plane line is a major reference to consider in determining the form of view to be drawn. -​</h2><br />
