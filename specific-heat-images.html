                                            Objectives
Petrol-driven motor vehicles such as the typical domestic car comprise of mechanical and electrical systems that generate heat and energy in close proximity to the fuel, petrol. Since the layout of most cars is somewhat similar and known to many delegates, in this hypothetical exercise, you are required to area classify the vehicle shown in below images.
The task is complete when the sketch of the car has been clearly marked with adequate information on the “hazard” and the area classification assigned to the vehicle in its various conditions of use. Indicate any areas you wish to designate Zone 0, 1 or 2. Give justifications for your answers (Q1a).
Supplementary instructions 
It is appreciated that you may have insufficient information to complete the task. Where you require more information, note this need adjacent to a relevant part or area. The vehicle detail shown is diagrammatic and is specifically for the purposes of this exercise. Any assumptions made should be recorded by appropriate annotations.
Side elevation of car
Plan view of car
Method of approach 
•	Use the principles and terminology outlined in Chapter 3 of this course. 
•	Assess the risk by taking account of the nature of the hazard. 
Consider the likely operational situations:
•	Parked in a garage.
•	Parked on the road.
•	Low speed.
•	High speed.
•	Engine running but car stationary 
•	Accidents of varying degree of severity 
•	Fuel leakage and spillage 
Your ideas should list the methodology used including:
•	The identification of all sources of ignition (electrical and mechanical).
•	The identification of all locations and routes (storage and piping) of fuel. 
Petrol flammability characteristics
•	Flashpoint: -40°C 
•	Ignition Temperature: 310°C
•	Vapour density: 1.24
•	Ignition energy: IIA
•	Vapour dispersion in still air: 4 metres in diameter from source of release. 0.5 metres high from the level ground 
You are urged to consider the following situations:
•	The vehicle is first started (from cold).
•	The engine running but the vehicle is stationary.
•	The car moves slowly, say, below 10mph/16kph.
•	Higher speeds above this value.
•	Accidents of varying degrees of severity.
•	Long term storage.
•	Fuel leaks and spillage.
a)	What other influences are present on the behavior of the fuel and/or vapour?
b)	How do you think the car can be made ‘safe’ from the risk of explosion?</a>

                            11. As a research consultant with Montalbano Estates Inc., you have been asked to find the sales distribution site in Cavite area for Brillantes Electrical Components, 3450 Anonas Avenue, Sta Mesa, Manila. Brillantes seeks suitable office space, including a reception area (where three office could work),one private office ,and a conference/ display area. Brillantes also wants 3000 square feet of heated warehouse space. It should be equipped with sprinkler system and have 18- foot ceilings. If sales are successful, Brillantes may need an additional 2000 square feet of warehouse space in the future. Brillantes needs access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport; moreover, it must be close to trucking terminals and main thoroughfares in an area zoned for light industry. It also seeks an impressive- looking building with the modern executive image. Brillantes wants to lease for at least two years with possible renewal. It needs to make a decision within three weeks. If no space is available, it will delay until next year.

3. Would you rely on primary or secondary research? How would you gather data for this report?
The purpose of primary research is to gather real-time data that will be useful in solving a specific problem. On the other hand, the purpose of secondary research is to gather existing research materials that may not directly address the problem at hand. Secondary research is worthwhile because it is generally more cost-effective than primary research and it provides a foundation for any project. Evaluating the current landscape of available information before moving on to primary research methods can save time and money that may be better spent elsewhere.</h2><br />

                            13. Objectives
Petrol-driven motor vehicles such as the typical domestic car comprise of mechanical and electrical systems that generate heat and energy in close proximity to the fuel, petrol. Since the layout of most cars is somewhat similar and known to many delegates, in this hypothetical exercise, you are required to area classify the vehicle shown in below images.
The task is complete when the sketch of the car has been clearly marked with adequate information on the “hazard” and the area classification assigned to the vehicle in its various conditions of use. Indicate any areas you wish to designate Zone 0, 1 or 2. Give justifications for your answers (Q1a).
Supplementary instructions 
It is appreciated that you may have insufficient information to complete the task. Where you require more information, note this need adjacent to a relevant part or area. The vehicle detail shown is diagrammatic and is specifically for the purposes of this exercise. Any assumptions made should be recorded by appropriate annotations.

Method of approach 
•	Use the principles and terminology outlined in Chapter 3 of this course. 
•	Assess the risk by taking account of the nature of the hazard. 
Consider the likely operational situations:
•	Parked in a garage.
•	Parked on the road.
•	Low speed.
•	High speed.
•	Engine running but car stationary 
•	Accidents of varying degree of severity 
•	Fuel leakage and spillage 
Your ideas should list the methodology used including:
•	The identification of all sources of ignition (electrical and mechanical).
•	The identification of all locations and routes (storage and piping) of fuel. 
Petrol flammability characteristics
•	Flashpoint: -40°C 
•	Ignition Temperature: 310°C
•	Vapour density: 1.24
•	Ignition energy: IIA
•	Vapour dispersion in still air: 4 metres in diameter from source of release. 0.5 metres high from the level ground 
You are urged to consider the following situations:
•	The vehicle is first started (from cold).
•	The engine running but the vehicle is stationary.
•	The car moves slowly, say, below 10mph/16kph.
•	Higher speeds above this value.
•	Accidents of varying degrees of severity.
•	Long term storage.
•	Fuel leaks and spillage.
a)	What other influences are present on the behavior of the fuel and/or vapour?
b)	How do you think the car can be made ‘safe’ from the risk of explosion?</h2><br />
