                                            YAWNING What makes us yawn? Yawning is something that we cannot control. Even in the mother's womb, eleven-week-old babies have been observed to yawn. But why do we do it? One popular explanation for yawning is that a person may be tired or bored. Although many believe this to be true, it cannot explain why athletes yawn before an event or why dogs yawn before an attack It is said that yawning is caused by a lack of oxygen and excess carbon dioxide. Agood example of this is when we yawn in groups. We yawn because we are competing for air. Others even believe that we yawn to cool our brains off. Cool brains allow us to think more clearly so yawning is said to help us become more alert.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One is that when we are bored or tired, we just don't breathe as deeply as we usually do. As this theory goes, our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed. Therefore, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            17. What makes us yawn? Yawning is something that we cannot control. Even in the mother's womb, eleven-week-old babies have been observed to yawn. But why do we do it? One popular explanation for yawning is that a person may be tired or bored. Although many believe this to be true, it cannot explain why athletes yawn before an event or why dogs yawn before an attack. It is said that yawning is caused by a lack of oxygen and excess carbon dioxide. A good example of this is when we yawn in groups. We yawn because we are competing for air. Others even believe that we yawn to cool our brains off. Cool brains allow us to think more clearly so yawning is said to help us become more alert. 1.what is a fact about yawning?A.it is s something we cannot control.B.it is something only humans do.C.it is a result of boredom.D . it is happens after birth.2. which of the following might Make us yawn?A. reading a bookB. being in a crowded roomC. being around plantsD . being in a small air conditioned car3. what does the word"involuntary"mean?A. expectedB . unexpectedC. within controlD. uncontrollable 4. which of the following may be a benefit of yawning?A. it warns us of possible attacks by dogs B. it provides us the carbon dioxide we need.C. it cools our brains D. it balances the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide.5. according to the selection' what is most likely to happen after we yawn?A. we will become more alert.B. we will be less tired.C. we will be less sleepy.D. we will be calmer.6. in the selection'how is the word' compete' used in the phrase''competing for air?A. struggling to take in some airB. arguing about breathingC. battling it out for oxygenD. racing. to breathe more air7. which of the following is the best response when we see a person/animal yawn?A. the passengers in an elevator yawned B.Several people yawned while picnicking at an open field.C.two people yawned inside a room with air-conditioning.D.three students yawned in big empty room.8.

                        <p>Yawning might serve a social function (to communicate boredom) and a physiological function (regulation of body state).</p><p></p><p>La Paresse: Caricature of sleep or boredom. Louis Léopold Boilly, 1824.  National Library of Medicine Digital Collections</p><p>The study of yawning is anything but boring. It boasts a rich history of theories that go back to Antiquity, but thus far the biological function of yawning remains a mystery.</p><p></p><p>Not all yawns are the same. Most of us yawn and stretch (pandiculation) when we wake up or go to bed, yawn when we are bored or when we need to “pop” our ears after traveling in high altitudes, and even yawn just because we saw someone else yawn. The act of yawning (oscitation) occurs in almost all vertebrates- even birds and fish exhibit a form of mouth gaping similar to yawning. In humans, yawning can start as early as 20 weeks after conception.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As this theory goes, our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed. Therefore, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood. Stretching and yawning may be a way to flex muscles and joints, increase heart rate, and feel more awake.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yawning helps with deep relaxation and reduces stress. Yawning helps contract the facial muscles during a yawn which forces blood through cerebral blood vessels to the brain, which may function to increase alertness.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Comment nyo nalang po kung mali para masagutan ko ng maayos</p><p>Pabrainliest narin po</p><br />
