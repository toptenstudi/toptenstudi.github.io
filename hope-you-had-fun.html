Dear Jane,
I was delighted to read you're letter last week. Its always a pleasure to recieve the latest news and to here that you and your family had a great summer.
We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that came at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax.
My kids are back in school to. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.
Thanks again for your letter!
Sincerely,
Karen</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 1Below are examples of comparison and contrast type of texts. Tell what is being compared/contrasted in each paragraph.1. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading,you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don't feel like interacting with new friends you just stop reading. Going on vacation gives you the opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and see new places with your eyes but you must spend much for your fare, your food, and the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily2. I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay that is why I know these two awesome tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that have five beaches, hillside terraces andcool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisines because people from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay is white and the sand is fine as powder. A village in Bali is famous for its gold and silver work. There is none of this in Boracay. There is a cultural centerin Ball called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shops where you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.3.  I never thought I would be homesick for my old school, but during my first week at my new school, I kept thinking how happy I had been there and how uneasy! was here. The trouble was, I didn't know anybody yet. At my new school, I felt at First, the teachers did not have time for me. Everyone seemed busy. Then I remembered the time when I first started going to my old school. I had felt the same way- a little lost and lonely- but after a while, I made friends. The strangeness wore off. Remembering that made me feel there was hope for my new school after all. ​</a>

                                            1. Read each short text carefully and tell whether it is  expository,  persuasive, descriptive, or  narrative,  (Rx 3 points) ____1. Junks food increases cholesterol and triglyceride levels which are major risk factors for the development of heart diseases. It can cause kidney disease, damage your liver, and can cause type ____2 diabetes. When you eat a healthy diet your body gets a steady supply of glucose which helps to maintain insulin sensitivity. Junk foods also increases your risk of cancer. Don't hesitate, stop eating junk foods now! 2. Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Leaming to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules! ____3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing in the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise. I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel reaixed and peaceful When I want to relax in summer, i go to the beach. ____4. One sunny morning, I and my siblings started to roam around inside a zoo. A lion rushed towards us and we were frightened. Their fierce looks were frightening. After seeing them, we came across a garden in which stags and deer were frisking about. These animals were very beautiful. I could smell good things like popcorn and yucky things like manure. There were lots of people at the zoo, too. It was a fun day. I hope I can go again. ____5. A salt seller used to carry the salt bag on his donkey to the market every day. On the way they had to cross a stream. One day the donkey suddenly tumbled down the stream and the salt bag also fell into the water. The salt dissolved in the water and hence the bag became very light to carry. The donkey was happy. Then the donkey started to play the same trick every day. The salt seller carne to understand the trick and decided to teach a lesson to it. The next day he loaded a cotton bag on the donkey. Again it played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would be still become lighter. But the dampened cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered. It leant a lesson. It didn't play the trick anymore after that day, and the seller was happy _____6.In most parts of the world, there are not so many crocodiles as there use to be This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamp and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the delimma as crocodiles have been desikred for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures people must take care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.  PAKI ANSWER PLSS..​</a>

I never thought I would be homesick for my old school, but during my first week at my new school, I kept thinking how happy I had been there and how uneasy I was here. The trouble was, I didn't know anybody yet. At my new school, I felt at first that the teachers did not have time for me. Everyone seemed busy. Then I remembered the time when I first started going to my old school. I had felt the same way- a little lost and lonely- but after a while, I made friends. The strangeness wore off. Remembering that made me feel there was hope for my new school after all.Note: wag kang sumagot kong hindi mo alam. Wag habol POINTS. Kaylangan kona.​</a>

The front part of the bus was the section for white Americans: the back part waspeople had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of thebus.2Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seatto a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and otherblack Americans received everyday.Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosoarrested by the police and sent her to jail.This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycottthe buses by not riding on them. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when goingto work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced tochange the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companieswere losing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the blackcitizens.SRosa's refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteenmonths after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregationin public transportation was unconstitutional. in 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a lawknown as the "Civil Rights Act of 1964" that put an end to racial discrimination in thecountry.The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative movefor the American people.Questions:1.

Below are examples of comparison and contrast type of texts. Tell what is 
being compared/contrasted in each paragraph.
1. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading, 
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel 
like interacting with new friends you just stop reading.
 Going on vacation gives you opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and 
see new places with your eyes but you must spend much for your fare, your food, 
and the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends 
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily. 
2. I haven’t been to Bali, Indonesia but I have read about it. I have been to 
 Boracay that is why I know these two awesome tourist destinations are similar in 
many ways. Both are small islands that have five beaches, hillside terraces and 
cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisines because people 
from all over the world visit them. However, Bali’s beaches are golden while those 
of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as powder. A village in Bali is famous for 
its gold and silver work. There is none of this in Boracay. There is a cultural center 
in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shops where you can buy 
goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.
3. I never thought I would be homesick for my old school, but during my first week 
at my new school, I kept thinking how happy I had been there and how uneasy I

The Emperor’s Seed — A Story About Integrity
There was once an Emperor who had no children and needed to choose a successor.
Thousands of children from across the kingdom came to the palace and were surprised when the Emperor exclaimed that he was going to choose one of them. He gave them all a seed. They were to go home to their villages, plant the seed in a pot and tend it for a year. When they return in a year, the Emperor would judge their efforts and choose his successor.
There was a boy named Ling who received his seed and returned to his village.
His mother helped him to choose a pot and put some soil into it.
Ling watered his pot every day.
Once a week, the children of the village would get together to compare their plants. After a few weeks, there were signs of life in all but Ling’s pot.
The weeks passed and Ling continued to water his pot every day.
After a few months, the pots really came to life. Some had trees starting to grow, some had flowers and some had leafy shrubs. Poor old Ling still had nothing growing in his pot, leading the other children to make fun of him.
Ling continued to water his pot every day.
A year passed and it was time to return to the palace to show what had grown and decide on the new heir.
Ling was anxious as his pot still showed no signs of life. “What if they punish me? They won’t know that I’ve watered it every day, they’ll think that I’m lazy.”
His mother looked him in the eye and explained that whatever the consequences were, he had to return and show the Emperor his barren pot.
Ling and the other children entered the palace gates. By now, some of the plants were looking magnificent and the children were wondering which one the Emperor would choose.
Ling was embarrassed as other children looked at his lifeless pot and scoffed.
The Emperor came out and started to make his way through the crowd, looking at the many impressive trees, shrubs and flowers that were on display. The boys all puffed their chests out and tried to look as regal as possible, hoping that they would be chosen as the heir to the empire.
Then the Emperor came to Ling. He looked at the pot then he looked at Ling.
“What happened here?” He asked.
“I watered the pot every day, but nothing ever grew.” Ling muttered nervously.
Then he moved on.
After a few hours, the Emperor finally finished his assessment looking at wonderful grown plants.
He stood in front of the children and congratulated them on their efforts.
“Clearly, some of you desperately want to be Emperor and would do anything to make that happen, but there is one boy that I would like to point out as he has come to me with nothing. Ling, come here please.”
“Oh no,” thought Ling. He slowly sauntered to the front of the group, holding his barren pot.
The Emperor held up the pot for all to see and the other children laughed. Then the Emperor continued, “A year ago, I gave you all a seed. I told you to go away, plant the seed and return with your plant. The seeds that I gave you all were boiled until they were no longer viable and wouldn’t grow, but I see before me thousands of plants and only one barren pot. Integrity and courage are more important values for leadership than proud displays, so Ling here will be my heir.”

                                            Biteable, we like to think we know a thing or two about creating great video commercials and ads. For fun, we decided to pool together some of our favourite commercials of all time to provide inspiration for your next video ad.What makes a great TV commercial or video ad?Since the very first television commercial ran — for $9 — more than 75 years ago, television advertising has grown into a $75 billion/year industry. Though TV’s market share has dropped as many viewers cut the cord, internet advertising has ensured that video ads are more popular than ever.So what does it take to make a good ad? Well, as you’ll see in the examples below, there are a few common traits the best commercials share.They’re memorable: From “Wassup!” to “Where’s the Beef?” the most successful ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your memory (whether you want them to or not!) Today’s average urbanite sees some 5000 advertising messages in a single day. Your job, as an advertiser, is to cut through the noise and stand out with a message that’s relevant, different, and effectively represents your brand identity.They’re shareworthy: For maximum exposure, your ad should make people want to talk about it with other people, both in real life and on social media. Usually the ads that inspire that kind of dialogue have elicited some kind of emotional reaction: they’re funny, shocking, weird, or emotionally touching.They communicate the brand’s values: The best ads capture the brand’s voice and identity, and communicate the ethos behind the company. Your audience should watch the ad and think, “this brand is for people like me.”Call to action: Lastly, an effective commercial makes it clear what it wants you to do next, whether it’s to visit a website, lease a car, or buy some candy. While some advertisers skip this step, incorporating the brand more subtly or focusing on awareness, you can really only get away with this if you’re already a household name like Nike or Apple.Create your perfect video in minutesGet started for free.Make a video — it’s free!Funniest CommercialsLet’s get this out of the way: humor is hard. What’s hilarious to one person might be downright annoying to another. When it’s effective, a funny ad can grab attention and inspire positive feelings for a brand. But a joke that falls flat can do the opposite, or even inspire a negative backlash.Moreover, experts are split on whether even a hilarious, popular ad will actually translate to increased revenue and awareness. In some cases, a funny ad can cause a so-called “vampire effect” in which viewers remember the ad, but not the product or company it’s associated with.The key, it seems, is to strike just the right balance between being funny, relevant, and informative. Here are some of the most effective, and funniest commercials we’ve seen:Old Spice: “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” (2010)When Old Spice realized that women made the majority of purchasing decisions when it came to men’s body wash products, they took a different approach with their next campaign. While the tagline “don’t let your man smell like a woman,” might not fly these days, the genuinely funny non-sequitur dialogue and Isaiah Mustafa’s perfect delivery made it a massive hit.Old Spice’s ad was perhaps the pinnacle of the absurdist, unpredictable, meme-able humor many advertisers have embraced, in hopes of creating a viral hit. And it worked. The ad took home nearly every major industry award that year and currently stands at over 55 million views on YouTube. Old Spice, meanwhile, has continued to hone their off-beat brand voice with a hugely popular follow-up campaign starring actor Terry Crews.Reebok: “Terry Tate, Office Linebacker” (2003)Slapstick violence: since the earliest days of comedy it’s been a foolproof way to make ‘em laugh. Reebok’s Super Bowl XXXVII ad had plenty, along with an amusing premise (boosting office productivity), an element of surprise, and solid one-liners and delivery.The spot was roundly praised by critics and viewers alike that year, though whether it actually succeeded in boosting Reebok’s brand is questionable. According to one poll after it aired, just 55% of viewers recalled that the ad was affiliated with Reebok. Though Reebok considered it nonetheless a success, citing a 4-fold increase in online sales, it’s still a good reminder to consider whether misaligned subject matter may cause your ad to become a victim of the ​</a>

Dear Jane,
I was delighted to read you're letter last week. Its always a pleasure to recieve the latest news and to here that you and your family had a great summer.
We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that came at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax.
My kids are back in school to. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.
Thanks again for your letter!
Sincerely,
Karen</h2><br />

                            9. 1. Read each short text carefully and tell whether it is  expository,  persuasive, descriptive, or  narrative,  (Rx 3 points) ____1. Junks food increases cholesterol and triglyceride levels which are major risk factors for the development of heart diseases. It can cause kidney disease, damage your liver, and can cause type ____2 diabetes. When you eat a healthy diet your body gets a steady supply of glucose which helps to maintain insulin sensitivity. Junk foods also increases your risk of cancer. Don't hesitate, stop eating junk foods now! 2. Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Leaming to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules! ____3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing in the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise. I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel reaixed and peaceful When I want to relax in summer, i go to the beach. ____4. One sunny morning, I and my siblings started to roam around inside a zoo. A lion rushed towards us and we were frightened. Their fierce looks were frightening. After seeing them, we came across a garden in which stags and deer were frisking about. These animals were very beautiful. I could smell good things like popcorn and yucky things like manure. There were lots of people at the zoo, too. It was a fun day. I hope I can go again. ____5. A salt seller used to carry the salt bag on his donkey to the market every day. On the way they had to cross a stream. One day the donkey suddenly tumbled down the stream and the salt bag also fell into the water. The salt dissolved in the water and hence the bag became very light to carry. The donkey was happy. Then the donkey started to play the same trick every day. The salt seller carne to understand the trick and decided to teach a lesson to it. The next day he loaded a cotton bag on the donkey. Again it played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would be still become lighter. But the dampened cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered. It leant a lesson. It didn't play the trick anymore after that day, and the seller was happy _____6.In most parts of the world, there are not so many crocodiles as there use to be This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamp and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the delimma as crocodiles have been desikred for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures people must take care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.  PAKI ANSWER PLSS..​</h2><br />

The front part of the bus was the section for white Americans: the back part waspeople had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of thebus.2Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seatto a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and otherblack Americans received everyday.Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosoarrested by the police and sent her to jail.This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycottthe buses by not riding on them. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when goingto work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced tochange the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companieswere losing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the blackcitizens.SRosa's refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteenmonths after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregationin public transportation was unconstitutional. in 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a lawknown as the "Civil Rights Act of 1964" that put an end to racial discrimination in thecountry.The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative movefor the American people.Questions:1.

                            15. ACTIVITY 1
Below are examples of comparison and contrast type of texts. Tell what is 
being compared/contrasted in each paragraph.
1. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading, 
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel 
like interacting with new friends you just stop reading.
 Going on vacation gives you opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and 
see new places with your eyes but you must spend much for your fare, your food, 
and the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends 
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily. 
2. I haven’t been to Bali, Indonesia but I have read about it. I have been to 
 Boracay that is why I know these two awesome tourist destinations are similar in 
many ways. Both are small islands that have five beaches, hillside terraces and 
cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisines because people 
from all over the world visit them. However, Bali’s beaches are golden while those 
of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as powder. A village in Bali is famous for 
its gold and silver work. There is none of this in Boracay. There is a cultural center 
in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shops where you can buy 
goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.
3. I never thought I would be homesick for my old school, but during my first week 
at my new school, I kept thinking how happy I had been there and how uneasy I 
was here. The trouble was, I didn’t know anybody yet. At my new school, I felt at 
first that the teachers did not have time for me. Everyone seemed busy. Then I 
remembered the time when I first started going to my old school. I had felt the 
same way- a little lost and lonely- but after a while, I made friends. The strangeness 
wore off. Remembering that made me feel there was hope for my new school after 
all.

                            21. READ THE STORY FIRST TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
The Emperor’s Seed — A Story About Integrity
There was once an Emperor who had no children and needed to choose a successor.
Thousands of children from across the kingdom came to the palace and were surprised when the Emperor exclaimed that he was going to choose one of them. He gave them all a seed. They were to go home to their villages, plant the seed in a pot and tend it for a year. When they return in a year, the Emperor would judge their efforts and choose his successor.
There was a boy named Ling who received his seed and returned to his village.
His mother helped him to choose a pot and put some soil into it.
Ling watered his pot every day.
Once a week, the children of the village would get together to compare their plants. After a few weeks, there were signs of life in all but Ling’s pot.
The weeks passed and Ling continued to water his pot every day.
After a few months, the pots really came to life. Some had trees starting to grow, some had flowers and some had leafy shrubs. Poor old Ling still had nothing growing in his pot, leading the other children to make fun of him.
Ling continued to water his pot every day.
A year passed and it was time to return to the palace to show what had grown and decide on the new heir.
Ling was anxious as his pot still showed no signs of life. “What if they punish me? They won’t know that I’ve watered it every day, they’ll think that I’m lazy.”
His mother looked him in the eye and explained that whatever the consequences were, he had to return and show the Emperor his barren pot.
Ling and the other children entered the palace gates. By now, some of the plants were looking magnificent and the children were wondering which one the Emperor would choose.
Ling was embarrassed as other children looked at his lifeless pot and scoffed.
The Emperor came out and started to make his way through the crowd, looking at the many impressive trees, shrubs and flowers that were on display. The boys all puffed their chests out and tried to look as regal as possible, hoping that they would be chosen as the heir to the empire.
Then the Emperor came to Ling. He looked at the pot then he looked at Ling.
“What happened here?” He asked.
“I watered the pot every day, but nothing ever grew.” Ling muttered nervously.
Then he moved on.
After a few hours, the Emperor finally finished his assessment looking at wonderful grown plants.
He stood in front of the children and congratulated them on their efforts.
“Clearly, some of you desperately want to be Emperor and would do anything to make that happen, but there is one boy that I would like to point out as he has come to me with nothing. Ling, come here please.”
“Oh no,” thought Ling. He slowly sauntered to the front of the group, holding his barren pot.
The Emperor held up the pot for all to see and the other children laughed. Then the Emperor continued, “A year ago, I gave you all a seed. I told you to go away, plant the seed and return with your plant. The seeds that I gave you all were boiled until they were no longer viable and wouldn’t grow, but I see before me thousands of plants and only one barren pot. Integrity and courage are more important values for leadership than proud displays, so Ling here will be my heir.”

                            28. Biteable, we like to think we know a thing or two about creating great video commercials and ads. For fun, we decided to pool together some of our favourite commercials of all time to provide inspiration for your next video ad.What makes a great TV commercial or video ad?Since the very first television commercial ran — for $9 — more than 75 years ago, television advertising has grown into a $75 billion/year industry. Though TV’s market share has dropped as many viewers cut the cord, internet advertising has ensured that video ads are more popular than ever.So what does it take to make a good ad? Well, as you’ll see in the examples below, there are a few common traits the best commercials share.They’re memorable: From “Wassup!” to “Where’s the Beef?” the most successful ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your memory (whether you want them to or not!) Today’s average urbanite sees some 5000 advertising messages in a single day. Your job, as an advertiser, is to cut through the noise and stand out with a message that’s relevant, different, and effectively represents your brand identity.They’re shareworthy: For maximum exposure, your ad should make people want to talk about it with other people, both in real life and on social media. Usually the ads that inspire that kind of dialogue have elicited some kind of emotional reaction: they’re funny, shocking, weird, or emotionally touching.They communicate the brand’s values: The best ads capture the brand’s voice and identity, and communicate the ethos behind the company. Your audience should watch the ad and think, “this brand is for people like me.”Call to action: Lastly, an effective commercial makes it clear what it wants you to do next, whether it’s to visit a website, lease a car, or buy some candy. While some advertisers skip this step, incorporating the brand more subtly or focusing on awareness, you can really only get away with this if you’re already a household name like Nike or Apple.Create your perfect video in minutesGet started for free.Make a video — it’s free!Funniest CommercialsLet’s get this out of the way: humor is hard. What’s hilarious to one person might be downright annoying to another. When it’s effective, a funny ad can grab attention and inspire positive feelings for a brand. But a joke that falls flat can do the opposite, or even inspire a negative backlash.Moreover, experts are split on whether even a hilarious, popular ad will actually translate to increased revenue and awareness. In some cases, a funny ad can cause a so-called “vampire effect” in which viewers remember the ad, but not the product or company it’s associated with.The key, it seems, is to strike just the right balance between being funny, relevant, and informative. Here are some of the most effective, and funniest commercials we’ve seen:Old Spice: “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” (2010)When Old Spice realized that women made the majority of purchasing decisions when it came to men’s body wash products, they took a different approach with their next campaign. While the tagline “don’t let your man smell like a woman,” might not fly these days, the genuinely funny non-sequitur dialogue and Isaiah Mustafa’s perfect delivery made it a massive hit.Old Spice’s ad was perhaps the pinnacle of the absurdist, unpredictable, meme-able humor many advertisers have embraced, in hopes of creating a viral hit. And it worked. The ad took home nearly every major industry award that year and currently stands at over 55 million views on YouTube. Old Spice, meanwhile, has continued to hone their off-beat brand voice with a hugely popular follow-up campaign starring actor Terry Crews.Reebok: “Terry Tate, Office Linebacker” (2003)Slapstick violence: since the earliest days of comedy it’s been a foolproof way to make ‘em laugh. Reebok’s Super Bowl XXXVII ad had plenty, along with an amusing premise (boosting office productivity), an element of surprise, and solid one-liners and delivery.The spot was roundly praised by critics and viewers alike that year, though whether it actually succeeded in boosting Reebok’s brand is questionable. According to one poll after it aired, just 55% of viewers recalled that the ad was affiliated with Reebok. Though Reebok considered it nonetheless a success, citing a 4-fold increase in online sales, it’s still a good reminder to consider whether misaligned subject matter may cause your ad to become a victim of the ​</h2><br />
