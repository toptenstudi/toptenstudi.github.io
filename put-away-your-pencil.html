                                            Creating a Dinosaur SculptureMaterials: pipe cleaners, clay, non-toxic paintWouldn't you like a scary dinosaur model on your desk to protect your pencils and textbooks? You can easily make one by following these simple directions. First, bend your pipe cleaner to make the frame of your dinosaur. I suggest you create a tyrannosaurus frame by using one long pipe cleaner as his neck, spine, tail, and then bend another into a u-shape to make his feet. Wrap the feet around the spine piece. Next, roll out clay to wrap around the pipe cleaners. Let the clay dry overnight. The next day you may want to paint your dinosaur as you wish. Nobody really knows how dinosaurs were colored, so don't let anyone tell you that your dinosaur can't be pink. Lastly, put him on your desk and watch as he or she scares away bullies and pencil thieves.1. What type of imformation text structure does this selection belong?A. DescriptionB. Time-orderC.

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</a>

Procedure 1. Choose a bar of soap. Any soap will work; however, a larger bar is easier to hold and gives more material to work with. Make sure you have a well- covered are to do your soap carving on. 2. Choose a knife to use. Soap is fairly soft, so a sharp knife is not absolutely necessary. Plastic knives, spoons, or popsicle sticks would also work. This is especially important to note to prevent any accidents from using sharp knives. 3. Draw an outline of your carving on one side of the soap. You can either draw the outline first using a pencil or directly using a knife, orange wood stick, or toothpick to scrape the outline into the soap. 4. Remove the soap outside the outline using small slivers or chips. Make sure to scrape away only small portions at a time, as it would be easier to remove than to put back an over scraped portion. Cutting off to much would cause the soap to break off into chunks. 5. Add details to the inside of your outline to refine the design further.

Lastly, put him on your desk and watch as he or she scares away bullies and pencil thieves.What Type of Graphic Organizer is the best for this?​</a>

                                            Activity: Making a Merlion Statue Model Materials you will need: ⚫ soap ⚫ knife ⚫ cutter ⚫ pencil ⚫ old newspaperProcedure: 1. Choose a bar of soap. Any soap will work; however, a larger bar is easier to hold and gives more material to work with. Make sure you have a well-covered area to do your soap carving on. 2. Choose a knife to use. Soap is fairly soft, so a sharp knife is not absolutely necessary. Plastic knives, spoons, or Popsicle sticks would also work. This is especially important to note if you are doing this project, to prevent any accidents from using sharp knives. 3. Draw an outline of your carving on one side of the soap. You can either draw the outline first using a pencil, or directly use a knife, orange wood stick, or toothpick to scrape the outline into the soap. 4. Remove the soap outside the outline using small slivers or chips. Make sure to scrape away only small portions at a time, as it would be easier to remove than to put back an over scraped portion. Cutting off too much would cause the soap to break off into chunks. 5. Add detail to the inside of your outline to refine the design further. When the carving is finished, wet your finger and rub the surface of the soap to create a smooth finish. Allow it to dry and harden for a day.​</a>

How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</a>

You can easily make one by following these simple directions. First, bend your pipe cleaner to make the frame of your dinosaur. I suggest you create a tyrannosaurus frame by using one long pipe cleaner as his neck, spine, tail, and then bend another into a u-shape to make his feet. Wrap the feet around the spine piece. Next, roll out clay to wrap around the pipe cleaners. Let the clay dry overnight. The next day you may want to paint your dinosaur as you wish. Nobody really knows how dinosaurs were colored, so don't let anyone tell you that your dinosaur can't be pink. Lastly, put him on your desk and watch as he or she scares away bullies and pencil thieves.1. What type of imformation text structure does this selection belong?A. DescriptionB. Time-orderC.

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</h2><br />

Description</p><p>This is pretty straightforward. Texts that use this structure simply describe something. With few exceptions, these texts also present plenty of details about what they're describing.</p><p></p><p>A text using this structure might also:</p><p></p><p>Tell you why something is being described</p><p>Tell you why the described topic is important</p><p>Provide examples of the described topic(s)</p><p>Descriptive texts are everywhere—in novels, works of literary nonfiction, news articles, science textbooks—which makes sense because the entire point of description is to present information.</p><p></p><p>2. Sequence/Instruction/Process</p><p>This text structure covers a few purposes:</p><p></p><p>Sequential instructions (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3; do this, then do that, and finally do this)</p><p>Chronological events (This happened, then this happened, then this happened, etc.)</p><p>Arguments that use evidence to support a claim (presenting evidence from least to most convincing)</p><p>When students read or write a text with this structure, order is key. Texts that use this format usually don't present any event or instruction out of order, as doing so would make its directions more difficult to follow.</p><p></p><p>As a ludicrous example, imagine a cake recipe in which preheating the oven is the last step. It would just be confusing and odd. Poorly written instructions just aren't worth your time.</p><p></p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of words and phrases that indicate a text follows the sequence/instruction/process text structure:</p><p></p><p>after	before	during	earlier</p><p>eventually	finally	first	from</p><p>how to	in order	last	meanwhile</p><p>next	now	until	while</p><p>3. Cause/Effect</p><p>Cause/Effect text structures explain, well, causes and effects. Sounds pretty simple! But works that use this structure can become complex when an effect has multiple causes (or vice versa).</p><p></p><p>Students will encounter complex examples of cause-effect when they read historical texts. Many events in history had more than one cause, all related in ways that can be difficult to unpack.</p><p></p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of words and phrases that indicate a text follows the cause/effect text structure:</p><p></p><p>because	cause	led to	reason</p><p>accordingly	effect	result	consequence</p><p>4. Compare/Contrast</p><p>This text structure involves a comparison involving multiple things, revealing how they are similar and how they are different.</p><p></p><p>Make sure your students know that contrasting two or more things doesn't necessarily mean identifying them as either good or bad. Comparisons simply relay the differences; therefore, one thing could have both positive and negative traits.</p><p></p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of words and phrases that indicate a text follows the compare/contrast text structure:</p><p></p><p>alike	also	both	comparable</p><p>even	in common	just as	similar</p><p>although	but	despite	difference</p><p>however	instead	otherwise	unlike</p><p>5. Problem/Solution</p><p>This text structure involves two parts:</p><p></p><p>The author identifies a problem</p><p>The author details a solution to this problem</p><p>Problem/Solution can be a very complex text structure, as it necessitates the use of other structures, too. Clearly, the author needs to describe the problem. The author would likely also explain the causes and effects of the problem in order to argue in favor of their solution. Does implementing the author's solution involve following a series of specific steps? That involves another structure. What if the author wants to mention other potential solutions and then explain why their solution is the best one? Oh, hello there, Compare/Contrast!</p><p></p><p>What's important here, as it is with any text in which an author marshals an argument, is that the author uses only the information needed to advance the argument or refute counterarguments. When students examine a text that uses the Problem/Solution text structure, they should examine at least two things: the argument as a whole and the individual components of it.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that aspects of other text structures might appear in the Problem/Solution one will help students examine the argument's individual components. That's why it's essential that students understand and can analyze the other four structures if you want them to be able to examine Problem/Solution effectively.</p><p></p><p>Looking for a series that makes teaching informational material easier?

Procedure 1. Choose a bar of soap. Any soap will work; however, a larger bar is easier to hold and gives more material to work with. Make sure you have a well- covered are to do your soap carving on. 2. Choose a knife to use. Soap is fairly soft, so a sharp knife is not absolutely necessary. Plastic knives, spoons, or popsicle sticks would also work. This is especially important to note to prevent any accidents from using sharp knives. 3. Draw an outline of your carving on one side of the soap. You can either draw the outline first using a pencil or directly using a knife, orange wood stick, or toothpick to scrape the outline into the soap. 4. Remove the soap outside the outline using small slivers or chips. Make sure to scrape away only small portions at a time, as it would be easier to remove than to put back an over scraped portion. Cutting off to much would cause the soap to break off into chunks. 5. Add details to the inside of your outline to refine the design further. When the carving is finished, wet your finger and rub the surface of the soap to create a smooth finish. Allow it to dry and harden for a day. ​</h2><br />

Creating a Dinosaur Sculpture  Materials: pipe cleaners, clay, non-toxic paint Wouldn't you like a scary dinosaur model on your desk to protect your pencils and textbooks? You can easily make one by following these simple directions. First, bend your pipe cleaner to make the frame of your dinosaur. I suggest you create a tyrannosaurus frame by using one long pipe cleaner as his neck, spine, and tail, and then bend another into a u-shape to make his feet. Wrap the feet around the spine piece. Next, roll out clay to wrap around the pipe cleaners. Let the clay dry overnight. The next day you may want to paint your dinosaur using non-toxic paint. His eyes should be white, but feel free to color your dinosaur as you wish. Nobody really knows how dinosaurs were colored, so don't let anyone tell you that your dinosaur can't be pink. Lastly, put him on your desk and watch as he or she scares away bullies and pencil thieves.What Type of Graphic Organizer is the best for this?​</h2><br />

How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</h2><br />
