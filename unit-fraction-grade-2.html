                    <p>What&#039;s In In the previous module, you have learned the different kinds of fractions. Fractions with the same denominators are called similar fractions. Fractions with different denominators are called dissimilar fractions. A fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction A fraction with a numerator that is equal to or greater than the denominator is called an improper fraction A fraction with a numerator of 1 is called a unit fraction. * A combination of a whole number and a fraction is called mixed number. Below are examples of proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed fractions. Directions: You may use colored pens or crayons to identify the type of fraction in doing the activity below. Color the balloons red if proper fractions, blue for improper fractions, and green for mixed number. 8 2 12 COM A 3 1 4 23 5nonsense answer report koGRADE 5 PO​</p>

                            1. What's In In the previous module, you have learned the different kinds of fractions. Fractions with the same denominators are called similar fractions. Fractions with different denominators are called dissimilar fractions. A fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction A fraction with a numerator that is equal to or greater than the denominator is called an improper fraction A fraction with a numerator of 1 is called a unit fraction. * A combination of a whole number and a fraction is called mixed number. Below are examples of proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed fractions. Directions: You may use colored pens or crayons to identify the type of fraction in doing the activity below. Color the balloons red if proper fractions, blue for improper fractions, and green for mixed number. 8 2 12 COM A 3 1 4 23 5nonsense answer report koGRADE 5 PO​</h2><br />
