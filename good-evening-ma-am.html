Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair. We need to book beyond ourselves and expand our circles of empathy-whom we wil help, whom we will, whom wer will ve for We need to ask the hand, important questions How can I make the world a better place for others? How do I make sure that I will love this world better man when bund it? Where am most needed now? Many of you have big dreams. Some of you want to be doctors and act wyers and accourants, engineers and architects, teachers and joumalas anong many others There a reason so put your rews on hot in fact, you called to pursue these dreams with even deeper sovet dream not only for yourselves and for your families, but for the at the east and the t Move forward Amid difficulty, what keeps me going is seeing that each small task, each affor help someone goes a long way. That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days. When the path seems too difficult, remember that you were made for the time-to pave a new way forward for our nation, and for the rest of DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: Answer each given question below using about 3 sentences.1.

By Ma. Melanie L. Padohinog
Kian is a smart boy who loves to learn almost everything. He always
excels in class the reason why his teacher adores him. He does all his best just
to make his parents proud of him. He dreams of becoming a policeman just
like his father.
One day, in school, Mrs. Pe, their English teacher, is teaching them
about “adjectives”. The whole class is enjoying their lesson. When Mrs. Pe
asked the class to give examples of adjectives, Romeo excitedly raised his hand.
He said, “Fat, Ma’am. Kian is fat. Ha!Ha!Ha!” The whole class laughed with him.
Mrs. Pe told the class, “Children, will you please excuse me? Romeo, please
come with me outside for a while.”When they are outside, Mrs. Pe said, “Romeo, do you think what you did
is good? You know, shaming someone is bad. It is not good to humiliate your
classmate. What do you think is the best thing that you will do now?”
Romeo answered, “Ma’am, I am very sorry. I did not realize that it will
hurt you and Kian. Don’t worry, Ma’am, I will ask an apology from Kian.”
“All right then, it’s okay. I’m happy that you understood that it is not
good to tease anybody. You may go to Kian now,” said Mrs. Pe with a smile.
Romeo went back inside the classroom and talked to Kian.
“I’m so sorry, Kian. I know what I did was wrong and even if you did not
say anything I feel that you were hurt. I promise I won’t do it again,” Romeo
said humbly.
“It’s okay, Romeo. I accept your apology,” Kian said happily.
To respect someone is to show consideration. It can boost the self-esteem
of another person.

How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

asked the class to give examples of adjectives, Romeo excitedly raised his hand.
He said, “Fat, Ma’am. Kian is fat. Ha!Ha!Ha!” The whole class laughed with him.
Mrs. Pe told the class, “Children, will you please excuse me? Romeo, please
